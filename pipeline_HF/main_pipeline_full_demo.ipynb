However, for breast development to occur in males, other mediators such as growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) are also required. The documents suggest that male and female breasts are histologically identical at birth, but estrogen- and progesterone-mediated breast development might explain why men do not develop breasts unless testosterone levels are low.\n","\n","\t\tQuestion 3/5: What is the link between chicken and man boobs?\n","\t\tAnswer 3/5: According to several news reports, a Chinese man grew breasts as a result of hormones found in fried chicken. However, it is important to note that chickens do not receive growth hormones (Chen et al., 2013). The higher estrogen levels in chicken fat may be the cause of the man's condition, as estrogens strongly stimulate the mammary gland (NCBI, n.d.).\n","\n","\t\tQuestion 4/5: What is the link between cow consumption and man boobs?\n","\t\tAnswer 4/5: The documents do not provide enough information to definitively answer the question about the link between cow consumption and man boobs. However, some sources suggest that cow's milk contains hormones like estrogen and progesterone, which are often associated with gynecomastia or \"man boobs.\" Additionally, one source lists dairy products as a potential cause of man boobs. However, another source states that soy products are also a potential cause, and yet another source lists beetroot, shrimp, strawberries, frozen meat, beer, canned and deep-fried foods as potential causes. Therefore, it is unclear from the provided documents whether cow consumption specifically is linked to man boobs.\n","\n","\t\tQuestion 5/5: What is the scientific explanation for gynecomastia in men?\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["The attention mask and the pad token id were not set.
