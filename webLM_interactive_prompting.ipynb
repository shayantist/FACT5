But how much are politicians willing to spend combating it? One proposal in particular that’s been the subject of scrutiny by Republicans is the Green New Deal. The ambitious plan aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, add millions of new jobs and provide universal health care, among other goals. It was put forth as a resolution in 2019 by Democratic House Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts. In the past, Ocasio-Cortez has put the price tag for her proposal at $10 trillion. But during the presidential debates last week, President Donald Trump claimed that the Green New Deal would cost $100 trillion — a figure refuted by climate experts and think tanks. And during Wednesday’s debates, Vice President Mike Pence criticized Biden’s climate plans, stating that “We don’t need a $2 trillion Green New Deal.” (Biden’s climate proposal is, however, not the GND and is far less sweeping. It doesn’t include, for example, universal health care.) The amount Trump cited was generously rounded up from a calculation done by the American Action Forum, a conservative group that estimated the deal’s price tag could reach between $51 trillion and $93 trillion based on health care, food security and green housing costs. However, Kira McDonald — a senior fellow at Data for Progress — said attaching any cost estimate to the Green New Deal “should be taken with several grains of salt and in most cases add up to deliberate obfuscation.” And James Goodwin, a senior policy analyst with the Center for Progressive Reform, said that one of the flaws with the American Action Forum’s estimate is that it didn’t take into account the benefits. While there’s a cost to spending more money on, say, clean energy, that also buys electricity, better public health outcomes and a sustainable climate. A 2017 report from the Government Accountability Office found that climate change has already cost U.S. taxpayers $350 billion over the past decade, which includes disaster assistance from flooding and storms. “The fundamental tenet, you could say, of the Green New Deal is to challenge the common notion that there’s this inherent tension between cleaning up the environment on one hand, and promoting a strong economy on the other,” Goodwin said. He said you can’t put a clear price tag on the proposal because it’s more of a vision. Like Goodwin, McDonald also said it’s more fair to think of the GND as a brand or strategy. Amy Sinden, a professor at Temple Law School, said the cost of not doing the Green New Deal, or a similarly large-scale effort to combat the climate crisis, would be catastrophic. “It’s like saying we shouldn’t spend money to fend off an asteroid that’s barreling toward earth threatening to destroy the planet because it’s too expensive,” she said. Since the original document for the GND came out, more detailed plans have been released. McDonald worked on estimates for a bill called the Green New Deal for Public Housing, which was introduced by Ocasio-Cortez and Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Data for Progress found that spending up to $172 billion over 10 years would create roughly 241,000 jobs across the country, reduce annual carbon emissions and reduce public housing energy bills, among other benefits. That money is roughly the same amount the government spent to bail out American International Group, the finance and insurance corporation, during the Great Recession. David Keiser, an associate professor of resource economics at the University of Massachusetts, has studied the cost and benefit estimates of federal environmental policies such as the Clean Water Act and the Clean Water Rule. The Clean Water Act is aimed at improving surface waters, which Keiser said might lead to improved recreational opportunities and improved amenities. But he noted that oftentimes, benefits like these are difficult to measure because they might affect things that aren’t bought and sold in markets. “You’re not necessarily walking down the street and buying an opportunity to recreate in a clean lake or a river,” he explained. “So oftentimes economists use a variety of different methods to try to recover the implicit values of those things.” Those methods might include observations of actual human behavior, and what those actions reveal about how much people value something. U.S. federal agencies, with some exceptions, have to calculate the cost and benefits of “economically significant” regulations they issue (those that have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more) under an executive order signed by President Bill Clinton. Clinton’s order is built off a 1981 rule issued by President Ronald Reagan, who called for the benefits of a regulation to outweigh the potential costs to society. Opponents at the time viewed the requirement as an attempt to assign values to things that are unquantifiable and deregulate business and industry. Although President Clinton’s rule had similar requirements, one difference is that it calls for the benefits of a regulation to “justify” the costs, not “outweigh” it. Paula Worthington, a senior lecturer at the University of Chicago, said the implementation of Clinton’s rule is when the U.S. started to develop a regular set of processes and protocols around cost-benefit analysis. Worthington said that a cost-benefit analysis can provide a structured way of looking at the impacts of a proposal, although it doesn’t give you the answer. “You don’t say at the end, ‘Well, clearly the benefits outweigh the costs, so let’s do it, or the other way around,” she said “Well-done, high-quality cost benefit analyses are closer to science, than to magic and poetry. But they still contain a lot of elements, where the analyst makes choices about what to consider and what not to consider. The most important thing when you’re producing a cost-benefit analysis is to be transparent and clear about your assumptions and your choices.” Goodwin, a critic of cost-benefit analysis, wrote that it ends up favoring “industry interests to the exclusion of public protections.” This methodology, he argues, is a major roadblock for programs like the Green New Deal. In June, the Environmental Protection Agency released a proposal of how major clean air rules are written by changing the way costs and benefits are analyzed. The proposal would focus only on the economic impact of a rule without taking into account possible benefits like public health. While a plan to combat climate change could end up costing trillions, climate change itself has — and will —end up costing lives. According to the World Health Organization, climate change is expected to cause an additional 250,000 deaths per year between 2030 and 2050.

Stanford experts discuss the science behind the politics. Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email By Rob Jordan Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment Eighty-six years ago, President Franklin Roosevelt delivered his first inaugural address to a nation mired in the Great Depression. Promising to “wage a war against the emergency,” Roosevelt hinted at the New Deal to come: an unprecedented series of massive public programs and projects intended to put America back to work. Although Stanford scholars have diverse opinions about the pathways to take to reduce carbon emissions, they agree on the urgency and importance of the issue. (Image credit: Romolo Tavani / Getty Images) In an echo of the past, the Green New Deal resolution drafted by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts labels climate change a “direct threat to the national security of the United States” and calls for the conversion of all U.S. power to clean, renewable energy sources and the creation of millions of green jobs, among other objectives. Supporters enthusiastically embrace the idea of a 10-year mobilization to reduce carbon emissions in the United States. Still, critics deride the plan as hopeless government overreach short on details and financial realism. Stanford Report spoke with Sally Benson, co-director of the Precourt Institute for Energy; Rob Jackson, chair of the Global Carbon Project; and Mark Jacobson, director of Stanford’s Atmosphere/Energy Program, about the Green New Deal’s strengths and weaknesses. Jacobson’s research has provided state- and national-level roadmaps for transitioning all energy sectors to 100 percent clean, renewable energy and storage. Jackson published a recent op-ed in The Hill about the plan. Benson was co-author of a 2018 paper highlighting “particularly difficult to decarbonize” parts of the energy system. While the scholars have diverse opinions about the fastest, most likely to succeed and lowest cost pathway to deep decarbonization, they agree on the urgency and importance of the issue. What components/details would a well done final Green New Deal (GND) have? Benson: Given the urgency of reducing emissions, we should pursue a strategy of “everything that works.” Now is not the time to take solutions off the table. Specifically, carbon dioxide capture, utilization and storage, and nuclear power should be considered, in addition to renewable energy resources. In California, for example, decarbonizing the electricity sector with renewables only would cost about two times more than when you include CCS [carbon capture and storage] and nuclear power. Our results are consistent with many global studies, such as those described in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports, showing that including some amount of CO2 capture and storage reduces the overall costs of deep decarbonization. I would also like to see the U.S. reach out to and partner with other countries to share knowledge about cost-effective deep decarbonization strategies. We don’t have time to waste with false starts and ineffective approaches to decarbonization. Related Story Science & Technology What does the future of energy look like? Stanford experts agree that the world needs to be less reliant on fossil fuels for energy. Getting there will remake the world’s largest economic sector – energy – into one that is more sustainable, secure and affordable for everyone. Jackson: We’d set a national path to net-zero emissions in the electric-power sector and work hard to decarbonize the tougher transportation and industrial sectors. The GND should also reduce methane and nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture and industry. It doesn’t need to pick winning technologies. Solar, wind, hydro, nuclear, even fossils with carbon capture and storage could play a role, with most of the gains coming from renewables. Jacobson: A GND should be based on transitioning all energy to 100 percent clean, renewable and zero-carbon wind-water-solar energy. This includes not only electricity, transportation, heating and cooling, but industry, agriculture and other energy use. Wind-water-solar excludes new nuclear power plants, fossil fuels with carbon capture, biofuels and capturing CO2 from the atmosphere aside from forestation. Such technologies increase air pollution, global warming, energy insecurity and other social costs compared with wind-water-solar. At least 37 papers among 11 independent research groups find that the electric grid can stay stable at low cost with at or near 100 percent wind-water-solar. What are the most important reasons/benefits of a GND? Jackson: Is saving the planet reason enough? I hope so. If not, how about the tens of thousands of Americans who die unnecessarily each year from coal-fired power plants and our vehicles, the two deadliest sources of air pollution in the country? Jacobson: Such a transition will eliminate 62,000 air pollution deaths per year in the U.S, saving taxpayers $600 billion a year. Climate costs savings to the world due to reducing U.S. emissions would be $3.3 trillion a year. These savings would continue for 100 years. The transition would create 2 million net jobs over those lost in the U.S. Benson: The Green New Deal is sparking an important and necessary conversation around the urgency of climate change. It’s a catalyst for a plan that will put us on an accelerated path to decarbonization. That starts with putting a price on carbon to incentivize industry to reduce emissions and unleash market forces to drive the best approaches to scale. Beyond these market forces, the government should step up funding of research, maintain regulations that drive energy efficiency and lead modernization of the electricity grid. What are the biggest potential problems/weaknesses of a GND? Jacobson: There is no technical or economic weakness, but social and political opposition is formidable. The fossil fuel industry has a lot at stake, and they sow doubt and oppose all legislation that will phase them out. The intent of the GND as originally written is to “transition off of nuclear and fossil fuels as soon as possible,” so the nuclear folks will try to oppose it as well. In addition, many people don’t care one way or the other and just don’t want to change their current lifestyle, so it is hard to encourage them to change. Jackson: Trying to do too much and accomplishing too little. The GND is right to couple climate action to poverty because poorer people are already bearing the brunt of climate’s costs. However, this coupling could make action more difficult. Many Democrats may see social change as necessary. Many Republicans may not. I don’t want those differences to keep us from cleaner energy and improved energy efficiency. Benson: The biggest potential problem would be broadly deploying technologies that aren’t yet sufficiently developed. We need to move as quickly as we can with technologies that are ready to go, like wind and solar power, and continue to develop other critical components of a deeply decarbonized energy system like large-scale weekly to seasonal energy storage. What would have to happen in American politics and society for a GND to pass? Jackson: There’s tremendous energy on the Hill for green energy and social change. Today’s politics differ vastly from the first New Deal, though, when one party controlled both the White House and Congress. We aren’t clawing our way out of a Great Depression, either. We do face a global climate crisis, and our youth understand the urgency. Because the first New Deal arrived in many bills, not one, the GND will too. I think we’ll see narrower bills with bipartisan sponsors, such as a national clean energy standard for electric power. Heartland voters in states like Texas, Iowa and Oklahoma share a lot with coastal voters in embracing cheap wind and solar power. I suspect we’ll see newer incentives for energy efficiency, electric vehicles, and carbon capture and storage technologies, as well. Jacobson: People need to realize how financially and job-beneficial the GND is. Approximately how much would it cost to institute a GND, and how could we pay for it? Jacobson: Rather than increasing costs, the GND reduces costs substantially. The upfront capital cost of a 100 percent wind-water-solar electric power generation system is about $9.5 trillion. However, this cost is spread out over many years and will pay itself off over time through electricity sales. Further, a wind-water-solar system uses half the energy as a fossil fuel system and also eliminates health and climate costs due to fossil fuels. As such, U.S. consumers will pay only $1 trillion per year in energy costs with the GND, whereas under a fossil fuel system, they will pay $2 trillion per year in energy costs and $600 billion per year in air pollution health costs, and will incur $3.3 trillion per year in global climate costs due to U.S. emissions, for a total economic cost of $5.9 trillion per year. Thus a wind-water-solar system costs society one-sixth that of a fossil fuel system. Jackson: No one can answer what it would cost because no specific agenda exists. To pay for it, a price on carbon emissions would help. A fee and dividend would price pollution, giving companies financial incentives to cut emissions. To have much chance politically, though, it may need to be revenue neutral, redistributing the funds to taxpayers. That redistribution is where social change could occur, but then again it wouldn’t pay for other aspects of the GND. Benson: It depends on what the GND becomes. We can take many actions today with low or no cost. For example, in many cases it is less expensive to use natural gas instead of coal for producing electricity, and more efficient cars and appliances can actually save money for consumers when you consider the total cost of ownership. Adding renewable power to the grid can also be cost effective, such as all of the wind power added in the Midwest and Texas and solar power in the Southwest. Within the next decade, owning an electric car is likely to be cost-competitive with a gasoline-powered car. On the other hand, comprehensive approaches for completely decarbonizing transportation and industry are not available today. R&D is needed to drive down costs for decarbonization technologies.

Learn about our Financial Review Board Fact checked by Kirsten Rohrs Schmitt Trending Videos Close this video player The term \"Green New Deal\" has been used to describe policies that address climate change policies and investment in renewable energy. The United Nations (UN) announced a Global Green New Deal in 2008. Former President Obama added one to his platform when he ran for election in 2008, and Green Party candidates, such as Jill Stein and Howie Hawkins, did the same. In 2019, a Green New Deal was a congressional resolution introduced by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Senator Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts. Key Takeaways The term \"Green New Deal\" has been used to describe policies that aim to make systemic change.The term was first used by Pulitzer Prize-winner Thomas Friedman in January 2007 and made popular by the proposal of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey in Congress in 2019.The deal emphasizes environmental and social justice while calling for new job creation. History of the Green New Deal The term \"Green New Deal\" was first used by Pulitzer Prize-winner Thomas Friedman in January 2007. Friedman recognized a solution to climate change that would require money, effort, and upsetting the fossil fuel industry. Transitioning away from fossil fuels, he argued in a New York Times column, would require the government to raise prices, introduce higher energy standards, and undertake a massive industrial project to scale up green technology. “The right rallying call is for a ‘Green New Deal,’” he wrote, referencing former President Franklin D. Roosevelt\\'s domestic programs to rescue the country from the Great Depression. “If you have put a windmill in your yard or some solar panels on your roof, bless your heart. But we will only green the world when we change the very nature of the electricity grid—moving it away from dirty coal or oil to clean coal and renewables.” Proposals 2019-2024 In 2019, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey introduced a 14-page nonbinding resolution in Congress calling for the federal government to create a Green New Deal. The resolution had over 100 co-sponsors in Congress and attracted several Democratic presidential candidates.According to the proposal, the U.S. and its historical contribution proved disproportionate greenhouse gas emissions. On March 26, 2019, lawmakers in the Senate voted 57-0 against advancing the resolution, with 43 out of 47 Democrats voting \"present\" to avoid a formal position.The Green New Deal proposed to tackle the climate crisis with a 10-year mobilization and address an issue that 60% of Americans said already affected their local community. The deal promised to tackle economic inequality by creating high-quality union jobs and called for the protection of workers’ rights, community ownership, universal healthcare, and a job guarantee. In April 2023, Senator Markey and Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez reintroduced the Green New Deal Resolution, but the resolution has not yet passed as of 2024. However, since the Green New Deal was first introduced, supporters saw some federal investment to fight climate change included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. In 2024, five years after the Green New Deal’s introduction, polling from Data for Progress shows 49% of voters view climate change more seriously than in the past. Goals of the Green New Deal The main goal of the plan is to bring U.S. greenhouse gas emissions down to net zero and meet 100% of power demand in the country through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources by 2030.The proposal calls for job creation, along with access to nature, clean air and water, healthy food, a sustainable environment, and community resiliency by: Providing investments and leveraging funding to help communities affected by climate change Repairing and upgrading existing infrastructure to withstand extreme weather and ensuring all bills related to infrastructure in Congress address climate change Investing in renewable power sources Investing in manufacturing and industry to spur growth in the use of clean energy Building or upgrading to energy-efficient, distributed, and smart power grids that provide affordable electricity Upgrading all existing buildings and building new ones so that they achieve maximum energy efficiency, water efficiency, safety, affordability, comfort, and durability. Supporting family farming, investing in sustainable farming, and building a more sustainable and equitable food system Investing in transportation systems, namely zero-emission vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing, public transit, and high-speed rail Restoring ecosystems through land preservation, afforestation, and science-based projects Cleaning up existing hazardous waste and abandoned sites Identifying unknown sources of pollution and emissions Working with the international community on solutions and helping them achieve Green New Deals Climate Change A common rebuttal to opponents from supporters of the Green New Deal is that although it will be expensive to implement, not doing so will be more expensive in the long run. To stop temperatures from rising beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius—the target aimed for in the 2015 Paris Agreement—global emissions need to go to zero by 2050. The federal government spent $450 billion due to extreme weather and fire events between 2005 and 2018, according to a 2018 report by the U.S. Government Accounting Office. In 2022, the U.S. experienced eighteen weather and climate disasters costing at least $1 billion. Climate change will cause more than $500 billion in economic loss in the United States alone each year by 2090, according to a 2019 study. Independent research shows that about 10% of the value of the global economy could be wiped out by 2050 if temperatures continue to rise by 3.2 degrees Celsius and the world doesn\\'t meet the net-zero targets outlined by the Paris Agreement. Supporters Advocates of the Green New Deal who promote a heterodox macroeconomic framework called Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) believe the government should not be concerned about the cost. \"The federal government can spend money on public priorities without raising revenue, and it won’t wreck the nation’s economy to do so,\" a group of prominent MMT supporters wrote in an op-ed for The Huffington Post. The Green Party, whose plan also calls for America to move to 100% clean energy by 2030 and a job guarantee, says it will result in healthcare savings and military savings. The party\\'s deal also advocates for a robust carbon fee program.Healthcare and other savings were also touted in a 2015 study by a group of scientists from Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley, that said the U.S. can replace 80% to 85% of the existing energy systems with ones powered entirely by wind, water, and sunlight by 2030 and 100% by 2050. Critics Critics call the Green New Deal socialist, extreme, or impractical. Some have warned that environmentalists \"want to take away your hamburgers.\"The kind of overhaul the deal calls for would be expensive and require significant government intervention. The center-right American Action Forum pegs the maximum cost at $93 trillion, while Tax Policy Center senior fellow Howard Gleckman said the plan may slow the economy by adding to the debt and even drive jobs overseas. \"Instead of the Green New Deal, the federal government could adopt a revenue-neutral carbon tax to decrease emissions without exacerbating the fiscal imbalance,\" said Jeffrey Miron, director of economic studies at the right-wing Cato Institute.Edward B. Barbier, the American economics professor who wrote the report that formed the basis of the UN\\'s Green New Deal, said that, instead of deficit funding, the government should use revenues from dismantled subsidies and environmental taxes. How Will the Green New Deal Affect Investors? Investment opportunities may arise with the passage of a Green New Deal. According to UBS, there is a long-term trend towards more sustainable and green ways of producing and consuming with investments in environmentally oriented sustainable industries.While a Green New Deal doesn\\'t explicitly call for eliminating fossil fuel usage, it may hit the industry hard, including nuclear energy stocks. Who Wrote the Green New Deal? The idea of a Green New Deal was first introduced by Thomas Friedman, who recognized there was no easy solution to climate change. In 2019, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass) introduced a proposal for a Green New Deal in Congress, though it failed to pass in the Senate. The proposal was reintroduced in 2023. How Would the Green New Deal Create Jobs? The Green New Deal promises to create millions of jobs by shifting money from the fossil fuel industry to green technology. The Bottom Line The term \"Green New Deal\" is synonymous with policies that tackle climate change and boost investment in sustainable energy. The term was first used by Pulitzer Prize-winner Thomas Friedman in January 2007 and gained momentum in 2019 with a proposal from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey in Congress.

But the proposal isn’t a simple fix for what ails the US. It would equal taking American society back to the drawing board and rebuilding it from the safety net up. As written, it is more a list of ideas and ideals than an actual proposal, although the new climate change regulations it suggests could run to $1 trillion. “Medicare for All”: Here’s what the health care proposal actually says What was entered as official legislative language on Capitol Hill declares the government should take a stronger position on everything from cutting carbon emissions to giving every American a job to working with family farmers to retrofitting every building in the country. Here’s a look at some passages that stuck out in the 14-page resolution, and what they might mean for the country: Renewable energy “meeting 100 percent of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources” This would be a wholesale turnaround in US energy. Renewables – including hydroelectric, wind, biomass, solar and geothermal – currently account for about 20% of US energy production, about on par with nuclear energy as outlined by the US Energy Information Agency. Natural gas accounts for the largest share – about 32% – and coal isn’t far behind, at 30%. The current projection is for renewable energy to account for about 31% of US energy generation by 2050, with steep drops for nuclear and coal. Smart grid “building or upgrading to energy-efficient, distributed, and ‘smart’ power grids, and working to ensure affordable access to electricity” Improving the nation’s patchwork electrical system is an enormous undertaking that Congress has been grappling with for more than a decade. It provided funds toward a smart grid – a reimagined electrical grid that makes use of technology to improve reliability and efficiency – as part of the 2009 economic stimulus, but not explicitly since then. The Department of Energy has provided some funds since then, according to the Congressional Research Service, putting $3.6 billion each year toward the smart grid – not nearly enough to implement it nationwide by 2030. It’ll cost hundreds of billions of dollars over 20 years, according to estimates, but greatly improve the country’s electrical infrastructure. Energy efficiency “upgrading all existing buildings in the United States and building new buildings to achieve maximal energy efficiency, water efficiency, safety, affordability, comfort, and durability, including through electrification” Without having to Google, we know there are a LOT of buildings in the US. Upgrading all of them would certainly make the green building industry explode. Would it be done through tax credits? Grants? Large-scale building upgrades have been tried before, including in the 2009 stimulus, which put $4.5 billion toward retrofitting federal buildings and $3 billion toward retrofitting public housing projects. Here’s a HUD report on the public housing effort, which argues that savings on electricity and water costs were achieved. However, to repeat, there are a LOT of buildings in the US, and no one knows what it would cost to make them all “green.” Transportation “overhauling transportation systems in the United States to eliminate pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible, including through investment in (i) zero-emission vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing; (ii) clean, affordable, and accessible public transportation; and (iii) high-speed rail” There are models to encourage low-emission vehicles that the current government is abandoning. Some federal tax incentives for people buying electric vehicles are running out (Tesla!) and haven’t been renewed. Others, like increased emissions standards, have been jeopardized by the Trump administration. Relatively cheap gas in recent years also hasn’t helped Americans move toward better fuel efficiency. But encouraging people with a tax incentive is different from overhauling transportation systems. And that’s hard: Just days after the Green New Deal was introduced, California’s new governor, Gavin Newsom, a Democrat and progressive, nixed his state’s planned high speed rail line from Los Angeles to San Francisco to instead focus on three smaller Central Valley communities. One reason Newsom said he didn’t end the program altogether was because he didn’t want the state to have to return a $3.5 billion federal loan. Low-tech solutions “removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and reducing pollution, including by restoring natural ecosystems through proven low-tech solutions that increase soil carbon storage, such as preservation and afforestation” This could cover a lot of things, one of which, essentially, would be planting trees to combat climate change. It’s a thing. It’s been tried in Israel and Europe and there are efforts to reforest in Brazil. It is the cutting of rainforests there, however, that plays a biggger role in climate change. Carbon Brief has a handy world map. The US Department of Agriculture and the Forest Service have a complicated cost estimate for afforestation in every county in the US. Another might be the protection and rehabilitation of wetlands to guard against the effects of climate change. Cows and climate change “working collaboratively with farmers and ranchers in the United States to eliminate pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector as much as is technologically feasible” This element has already been boiled down to cow farts, according to the President and that prematurely published set of FAQs. Cow and livestock emissions are something that deserves attention. This is not about your your purebred heritage cow, but rather about industrial agriculture. Beef is responsible for 41% of livestock greenhouse gas emissions, and that livestock accounts for 14.5% of total global emissions, according to a CNN special report this year, which also pointed to the UN Panel on Climate Change Report, which suggested changing diets worldwide could contribute 20% of the effort needed to keep down global temperatures. The USDA projects the average American will eat about 222.4 pounds of meat and poultry in 2019, 53.4 pounds of which will be beef. Guaranteed job, leave, vacation and retirement “guaranteeing a job with a family-sustaining wage, adequate family and medical leave, paid vacations, and retirement security to all people of the United States” Here we veer from the climate change portion of the document to goals that seem even more difficult to achieve. Would a family-sustaining wage mean different pay for people with different numbers of children? Would it require that both adults in a given household work? The living wage in Springfield, Illinois – chosen randomly – in MIT’s Living Wage calculator is $11.41 per hour for one adult and $18.44 for two adults and two children. If one of the adults is working part-time, the baseline hourly wage rises to $26.39. Things change when you factor in benefits. An interesting 2018 report from the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities with some back-of-the envelope calculations on the cost for a federal jobs guarantee suggested the government could provide 9.7 million jobs to the under- or unemployed at a mean wage of $32,500 to account for different levels of experience, etc. Adding in taxes and benefits makes the annual cost of each job about $56,000. So the total cost to the government each year would be about $543 billion. That’s less than the nearly $674 billion the government spends on the Pentagon’s budget. It is much less than the government spends on safety net programs Medicare and Social Security each year. Labor laws “strengthening and enforcing labor, workplace health and safety, anti-discrimination, and wage and hour standards across all employers, industries, and sectors” There’s a patchwork of wage laws across industries. Tipped workers, like restaurant employees, have a lower minimum wage. Some states have enacted much higher minimum wages for their workers. Creating new laws on this front would require a national debate. Discrimination is already illegal. But it also has very little to do with climate change. Public ownership “providing and leveraging, in a way that ensures that the public receives appropriate ownership stakes and returns on investment, adequate capital (including through community grants, public banks, and other public financing), technical expertise, supporting policies, and other forms of assistance to communities, organizations, Federal, State, and local government agencies, and businesses working on the Green New Deal mobilization” The public is going to pay for all of this change, so the public should get a return, is one way to look at this passage. The public as an owner is likely enough to strike fear in many Republicans. And it’d be a sure trigger for them to bring up Venezuela, which has squandered the riches of its state-run oil company. On the other hand, California is again dealing with the bankruptcy of a privately owned public utliity, PG&E, and debating whether it should be turned into a public utility. How governments should own things is an important question without a clear answer. Providing higher education “providing resources, training, and high-quality education, including higher education, to all people of the United States, with a focus on frontline and vulnerable communities, so those communities may be full and equal participants in the Green New Deal mobilization” There’s a lot in this portion, but let’s focus on the part about higher education for all people. That sounds a lot like the free-college proposals of recent years. It might not be something any Democrats are going to oppose, exactly. But it’s also not something they’ve found a way to accomplish yet. One free-college proposal, which was not included in Green New Deal but offers a guideline, came from from Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent. He would provide states with $47 billion per year to cover two-thirds of the cost of tuition for students at public colleges and universities. Sanders proposed a new tax on Wall Street trades to finance the program. Trade unions “strengthening and protecting the right of all workers to organize, unionize, and collectively bargain free of coercion, intimidation, and harassment” Unions have been in a long-term decline in the US. While 20% of US wage and salary workers were in unions in 1983 – about 17.7 million people, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics – that was down to 10.5% of wage and salary workers and 14.7 million union workers by 2018. There are many reasons for this decline, not the least of which is the changing nature of US manufacturing. Unions remain strongest in the public sector and among government workers ranging from law enforcement to teachers. An additional 1.6 million workers are in jobs covered by union contracts but are not members of the unions. Trade deals “enacting and enforcing trade rules, procurement standards, and border adjustments with strong labor and environmental protections” In this case Green New Dealers might align with Trump against trade deals, as Sen. Elizabeth Warren has. She, like Trump, opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He said it was poorly negotiated. She said it didn’t do enough for international worker rights. But the Green New Deal crowd goes further, and opposes even the deals Trump supports, like the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, which Warren called NAFTA 2.0 – though she ultimately wound up supporting it. Indigenous people “obtaining the free, prior, and informed consent of indigenous people for all decisions that affect indigenous people and their traditional territories, honoring all treaties and agreements with indigenous people, and protecting and enforcing the sovereignty and landrights of indigenous people” You could see this playing a role in particular in terms of oil drilling, in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge or in terms of standoffs like the one at Standing Rock in North Dakota in 2016. This would certainly be a policy shift for the US government, which has at times seemed to give deference to oil companies. There could be lost development opportunities, but many Democrats would certainly trade that for the twin objectives of slowing oil dependence and honoring indigenous peoples. Health care, housing, security, clean air and water, healthy food and nature “providing all people of the United States with — (i) high-quality health care; (ii) affordable, safe, and adequate housing; (iii) economic security; and (iv) access to clean water, clean air, healthy and affordable food, and nature” This is lumping a lot of things in together. The quibble here between progressives and conservatives will be whether the US government should be providing access to health care. Many Green New Deal supporters all support “Medicare-for-all,” which is both a general idea that many Democrats are behind and also a specific policy proposal that has fewer supporters. One question is whether the government would have to essentially end the private health care industry in order to create a public one. That kind of drastic change has the potential to really frighten voters, who punished Democrats for creating the Affordable Care Act in 2010 and then published Republicans for trying to take it away in 2018. The government already does quite a lot, although some say not nearly enough, on the food, water, air and nature fronts with the Food and Drug Administration, the USDA, the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Park Service, so it’s hard to so say what would change under a Green New Deal without more specifics. This story was originally published on February 14, 2019. It has been updated to reflect the passage of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement.

The Green New Deal Is Bad Environmental Policy, Too COMMENTARY Environment It’s Not Just About Cost. The Green New Deal Is Bad Environmental Policy, Too Nov 15, 2019 3 min read COMMENTARY BY Nicolas Loris @NiconomistLoris Former Deputy Director, Thomas A. Roe Institute Nick is an economist who focused on energy, environmental, and regulatory issues as the Herbert and Joyce Morgan fellow. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) attends a news conference to introduce legislation to transform public housing as part of the Green New Deal outside the U.S. Capitol November 14, 2019. Chip Somodevilla / Staff / Getty Images Key Takeaways Researchers estimate it would take more than $5 trillion just to switch from coal, nuclear and natural gas to 100% renewables. The Green New Deal would massively expand the size and scope of the federal government\\'s control over activities best left to the private sector. The reality is that environmental policies aren\\'t good for the environment if they\\'re so bad for people. Copied We\\'re not hearing much about the \"Green New Deal\" these days, but it\\'s still a priority for some candidates, as anyone who\\'s attended a recent Bernie Sanders rally can attest. Criticism of the GND tends to center on cost and rightly so. It would be extremely expensive. Researchers estimate it would take more than $5 trillion just to switch from coal, nuclear and natural gas to 100% renewables. But even if you set economic concerns aside, an ironic fact remains: In the United States and around the world, the central-planning policies at the heart of the GND have a horrible track record for the environment. Governments in countries such as Venezuela and China (or in the past like the Soviet Union and Cuba) either routinely mismanage and waste resources, or ramp up production with little to no accountability for environmental damage that comes with it. The absence of price signals reduces the incentive to be more efficient and do more with less. In addition, the absence of property rights reduces the incentive to conserve and gives government-controlled industries a free pass to pollute without compensating or protecting its citizens. The Green New Deal would massively expand the size and scope of the federal government\\'s control over activities best left to the private sector. It would empower the feds to change and control how people produce and consume energy, harvest crops, raise livestock, build homes, drive cars and manufacture goods. Secondly, the Green New Deal would result in a number of unintended consequences. For instance, policies that limit coal, oil and natural gas production in the United States will not stop the global consumption of these natural resources. Production will merely shift to places where the environmental standards are not as rigorous, making the planet worse off. Moreover, it\\'s not as if wind, solar and battery technologies magically appear. Companies still have to mine the resources, manufacture the product and deal with the waste streams. There are challenges to disposing potentially toxic lithium-ion batteries and solar panels, or even wind turbine blades that are difficult and expensive to transport and crush at landfills. While these are solvable problems, they\\'re seldom discussed by GND proponents. There would also be massive land use changes required to expand renewable power. Ben Zycher at the American Enterprise Institute estimates that land use necessary to meet a 100% renewable target would require 115 million acres, which is 15% larger than the land area of California. Two recent National Bureau of Economic Research papers underscore the unintended consequences of energy policy on human well-being. One found that cheaper home heating because of America\\'s fracking revolution is averting more than 10,000 winter deaths per year. The Green New Deal would wipe all of that away, and reverse course by mandating pricier energy on families. Another paper found that the Japanese government\\'s decision to close safely operating nuclear power plants after Fukashima increased energy prices and reduced consumption, which consequently, increased mortalities from colder temperatures. In fact, the authors estimate that \"the decision to cease nuclear production has contributed to more deaths than the accident itself.\" Unintended consequences. Another hallmark of bad environmental policy is focusing on outputs, not outcomes. According to the frequently asked questions sheet released along with the Green New Deal, it is \"a massive investment in renewable energy production and would not include creating new nuclear plants.\" One would think that if we only have 11 or 12 years to act on climate change, we\\'d want to grab the largest source of emissions-free electricity we can get. But that\\'s not the case. That\\'s typical for most big-government environmental policies: they\\'re so focused on prescriptive ways to control peoples\\' behaviors that they crowd out or ignore opportunities for innovative solutions. The reality is that environmental policies aren\\'t good for the environment if they\\'re so bad for people. The costs of the GND would be devastatingly high for households. Government policies that drive up energy bills are not only very regressive, but they would also harm consumers multiple times as they pay more for food, clothes and all of the other goods that require energy to make. By shrinking our economy by potentially tens of trillions of dollars, the Green New Deal will cause lower levels of prosperity and fewer resources to deal with whatever environmental challenges come our way. That\\'s a bad deal for our economy and our environment.

The name refers to the New Deal, a set of reforms and public works projects undertaken by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933-1935 in response to the Great Depression in the United States.[1] The Green New Deal combines Roosevelt\\'s economic approach with modern ideas such as renewable energy and resource efficiency.[2][3] A prominent 2019 attempt to get legislation passed for a Green New Deal was sponsored by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) during the 116th United States Congress, though it failed to advance in the Senate.[4] In the European Union, a 2019 proposal from the European commission for a European Green Deal was supported by the European Council, and in January 2020, by the European Parliament as well.[5] Since the early 2000s, and especially since 2018, other proposals for a \"Green New Deal\" had arisen both in the United States and internationally.[6][7][8] The first U.S. politician to run on a Green New Deal platform was Howie Hawkins of the Green Party when he ran for governor of New York in 2010.[9] Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein ran on a Green New Deal platform in 2012 and 2016.[10] History[edit] Sustainable agriculture combined with renewable energy generation Throughout the 1970s and 1990s, an economic policy to move the United States economy away from nonrenewable energy was developed by activists in the labor and the environmental movements.[11][citation needed] An early use of the phrase \"Green New Deal\" was by journalist Thomas Friedman.[12] He argued in favor of the idea in The New York Times and The New York Times Magazine.[13][14] In January 2007, Friedman wrote:If you have put a windmill in your yard or some solar panels on your roof, bless your heart. But we will only green the world when we change the very nature of the electricity grid – moving it away from dirty coal or oil to clean coal and renewables. And that is a huge industrial project – much bigger than anyone has told you. Finally, like the New Deal, if we undertake the green version, it has the potential to create a whole new clean power industry to spur our economy into the 21st century.[14] Friedman expanded upon the idea in his September 2008 book Hot, Flat, and Crowded.[15] This approach was taken up in Britain by the Green New Deal Group,[16] which published its eponymous report on July 21, 2008.[17] The concept was further popularized and put on a wider footing when the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) began to promote it internationally. In early 2008, author Jeff Biggers launched a series of challenges for a Green New Deal from the perspective of his writings from coal country in Appalachia. Biggers wrote, \"(then-presidential candidate) Obama should shatter these artificial racial boundaries by proposing a New \\'Green\\' Deal to revamp the region and bridge a growing chasm between bitterly divided Democrats, and call for an end to mountaintop removal policies that have led to impoverishment and ruin in the coal fields.\"[18] Biggers followed up with other Green New Deal proposals over the next four years.[19] The Green Party of the United States and Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein proposed a \"Green New Deal\" beginning in 2012.[20][21][22] A Green New Deal remains officially part of the platform of the Green Party of the United States.[23] COVID-19 recovery programs[edit] See also: Green recovery and COVID-19 pandemic By 2019, international calls for a Green New Deal had already became more prominent. This reflected the popular support the GND had received in the US in late 2018, growing recognition of the global warming threat resulting from recent extreme weather events, the Greta effect and the IPPC 1.5 °C report. In addition to activity within conventional national & multilateral politics, there has been support for a Green New Deal within city diplomacy. In October 2019 the C40 committed to supporting a Global Green New Deal, announcing there will be determined action from all its 94 cities, with 30 cities having already peaked their emissions and progressing rapidly towards net-zero.[24][25] There were further proposals to include a GND, both in the US and internationally, in the recovery program for the COVID-19 pandemic.[26][27][28][7][8][29] In December 2020 however, the United Nations released a report saying that a high proportion of the world\\'s COVID-19 recovery stimulus was not going towards clean energy. UN secretary general António Guterres declared the world\\'s governments were \"doubling down\" on fossil fuels.[30][31] As of 2021, commentators such as the Council on Foreign Relations have noted that in addition to climate-friendly policies being enacted in the U.S. by Joe Biden, other major economies such as China, India, and the European Union have also begun \"implementing some of the policies envisioned by the Green New Deal.\"[32][33] Environmental justice[edit] Main article: Environmental justice The 2019 United States congressional resolution Recognizing the duty of the Federal Government to create a Green New Deal introduced by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ed Markey advocated a \"just transition\", counteracting previous systemic injustices that had disproportionally hurt vulnerable communities. Commentators have called for future Green New Deal-type programs to also emphasize environmental justice, both in the United States and overseas.[34][35][36] Other commentators, while agreeing on the need for the incorporation of justice, have cautioned against excessive emphases on identity politics, or on bundling in too many economically progressive measures. They fear including too much in a GND package will make it harder to achieve broad based majority support. Polls had found that in 2019 the Ocasio-Cortez and Markey GND was initially supported by a majority of conservatives. Yet after a few months of hostile criticism by shows like Fox News for being excessively socialist, only about 35% of American conservatives remained in support.[37][38] Australia[edit] The Australian Greens have advocated for a \"Green Plan\", similar to the Green New Deal, since 2009.[39] Deputy Leader Christine Milne discussed the idea on the ABC\\'s panel discussion program Q&A on February 19, 2009,[40] and it was the subject of a major national conference of the Australian Greens in 2009.[41] Canada[edit] In early May 2019, with rising concerns about the need for urgent global environmental action to reduce potentially catastrophic effects of climate change, a non-partisan coalition of nearly 70 groups launched the Pact for a Green New Deal (New Deal vert au Canada in French).[42] With press conferences in Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver, the coalition called for fossil fuel emissions to be halved by 2030.[43][44] On May 16, 2019 the Green Party released a 5-page summary of their plan entitled \"Mission: Possible: The Green Climate Action Plan\".[45] European Union[edit] Main article: European Green Deal On continental Europe, the European Spring coalition campaigned under the banner of a \"Green New Deal\" for the 2019 EU elections.[7][8] In December 2019, the newly elected European Commission under Von der Leyen presented a set of policy proposals under the name European Green Deal. Compared to the United States plan, it has a less ambitious decarbonisation timeline, with an aim of carbon neutrality in 2050. The policy proposal involves every sector in the economy and the option of a border adjustment mechanism, a \\'carbon tariff\\', is on the table to prevent carbon leakage from outside countries.[46] A pilot program for a four-day workweek, under development by Spain\\'s Valencian Regional Government, has been described as a \"helpful counter to ... fearmongering about the bleak, hamburger-free world climate activists are allegedly plotting to create with a Green New Deal.\"[47] In April 2020 the European Parliament called to include the European Green Deal in the recovery program from the COVID-19 pandemic.[28] The proposals were criticised for falling short of the goal of ending fossil fuels, or being sufficient for a green recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic.[48] In its place, it has been proposed that the EU enacts a \"Green New Deal for Europe\", which includes more investment, and changes the legal regulation that enables global warming from coal, oil, and gas to continue.[49] In July 2021, the European Commission released its \"Fit for 55\" legislation package, which contains important guidelines for the future of the automotive industry; all new cars on the European market must be zero-emission vehicles from 2035.[50] According to European Commissioner for Climate Action Frans Timmermans, \"the best answer\" to the 2021 global energy crisis is \"to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.\"[51] South Korea[edit] In 2020, after the Democratic Party won an absolute majority in the National Assembly, the leadership of the country began to advance a Green New Deal. It includes: Achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. South Korea is the first country in east Asia committing to this target. Expanding investments in renewable energy. Stopping investments in coal in the country and outside it. Establishing a carbon tax. Creating a Regional Energy Transition Centre to ensure that the coal workers will not suffer and will be transitioned to green jobs.[52] United Kingdom[edit] In the UK, the Green New Deal Group and the New Economics Foundation produced the A Green New Deal report asking for a Green New Deal as a way out of the Global Financial Crisis back in 2008, demanding a reform of the financial and tax sectors and a revolution of the energy sector in the country. Also, Green MP for Brighton Pavilion, Caroline Lucas, raised the idea during an economic debate in 2008.[53] In March 2019, Labour Party members launched a grassroots campaign called Labour for a Green New Deal. The aim of the group is to push the party to adopt a radical Green New Deal to transform the UK economy, tackle inequality and address the escalating climate crisis. It also wants a region-specific green jobs guarantee, a significant expansion of public ownership and democratic control of industry, as well as mass investment in public infrastructure.[54] The group states that they got their inspiration from the Sunrise Movement and the work that congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has done in the US. Group members have met with Zack Exley, co-founder of the progressive group Justice Democrats, to learn from the experiences that he and Ocasio-Cortez have had in working for the Green New Deal campaign in the US.[55] On April 30, former Labour Party leader Ed Miliband joined Caroline Lucas and former South Thanet Conservative MP Laura Sandys in calling for a Green New Deal in the UK.[56] The left-wing campaigning group Momentum also wish to influence the Labour Party\\'s manifesto to include a Green New Deal.[57] In September 2019, the Labour party committed to a Green New Deal at its 2019 annual conference. This included a target to decarbonise by 2030.[6][58] Polling undertook by YouGov in late October 2019 found that 56% of British adults support the goal of making the UK carbon neutral by 2030 or earlier.[59] In July 2020, while the UK government promised a \"green recovery\" from the COVID-19 pandemic, this was criticised as being insufficient, and lacking changes to regulation that enabled coal, oil, and gas pollution to continue.[60] An alternative \"Green Recovery Act\", widely endorsed by politicians and the media,[61] was published by an academic and think tank group that would target nine fields of law reform, on transport, energy generation, agriculture, fossil fuels, local government, international agreement, finance and corporate governance, employment, and investment. This has the goal of establishing duties on all public bodies and regulators to end use of all coal, oil and gas \"as fast as technologically practicable\", with strict exceptions if there are not yet technical alternatives.[62] United States[edit] Early efforts[edit] In 2006, a Green New Deal was created by the Green New Deal Task Force as a plan for one hundred percent clean, renewable energy by 2030 utilizing a carbon tax, a jobs guarantee, free college, single-payer healthcare, and a focus on using public programs.[63][64] Since 2006, the Green New Deal has been included in the platforms of multiple Green Party candidates, such as Howie Hawkins\\' gubernatorial campaigns in 2010, 2014, and 2018, and Jill Stein\\'s 2012 and 2016 presidential campaigns.[63] In the 2014 Congressional race in California, Independent candidate for CA-33 and author Marianne Williamson endorsed the Green New Deal in her campaign platform.[65] The Rep. Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Markey Green New Deal[edit] See also: Recognizing the duty of the Federal Government to create a Green New Deal Background[edit] A \"Green New Deal\" wing began to emerge in the Democratic Party after the November 2018 elections.[66][67] A possible program in 2018 for a \"Green New Deal\" assembled by the think tank Data for Progress was described as \"pairing labor programs with measures to combat the climate crisis.\"[68][69] A November 2018 article in Vogue stated, \"There isn\\'t just one Green New Deal yet. For now, it\\'s a platform position that some candidates are taking to indicate that they want the American government to devote the country to preparing for climate change as fully as Franklin Delano Roosevelt once did to reinvigorating the economy after the Great Depression.\"[70] A week after the 2018 midterm elections, climate justice group Sunrise Movement organized a protest in Nancy Pelosi\\'s office calling on Pelosi to support a Green New Deal. On the same day, freshman congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez launched a resolution to create a committee on the Green New Deal.[71] Following this, several candidates came out supporting a \"Green New Deal\", including Deb Haaland, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, and Antonio Delgado.[72] They were joined in the following weeks by Reps. John Lewis, Earl Blumenauer, Carolyn Maloney, and José Serrano.[73] By the end of November, eighteen Democratic members of Congress were co-sponsoring a proposed House Select Committee on a Green New Deal, and incoming representatives Ayanna Pressley and Joe Neguse had announced their support.[74][75] Draft text would task this committee with a \"\\'detailed national, industrial, economic mobilization plan\\' capable of making the U.S. economy \\'carbon neutral\\' while promoting \\'economic and environmental justice and equality,\\'\" to be released in early 2020, with draft legislation for implementation within 90 days.[76][77] Organizations supporting a Green New Deal initiative include the Sunrise Movement, 350.org, Greenpeace, Sierra Club, Extinction Rebellion and Friends of the Earth.[78][79] A Sunrise Movement protest on behalf of a Green New Deal at the Capitol Hill offices of Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer on December 10, 2018 featured Lennox Yearwood and speakers as young as age 7, resulting in 143 arrests.[80] Euronews, the pan-European TV network, displayed video of youth with signs saying \"Green New Deal,\" \"No excuses\", and \"Do your job\" in its \"No Comment\" section.[81] On December 14, 2018, a group of over 300 local elected officials from 40 states issued a letter endorsing a Green New Deal approach.[82][83] That same day, a poll released by Yale Program on Climate Change Communication indicated that although 82% of registered voters had not heard of the \"Green New Deal,\" it had strong bi-partisan support among voters. A non-partisan description of the general concepts behind a Green New Deal resulted in 40% of respondents saying they \"strongly support\", and 41% saying they \"somewhat support\" the idea.[84] On January 10, 2019, over 600 organizations submitted a letter to Congress declaring support for policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This includes phasing out fossil fuel extraction and ending fossil fuel subsidies, transitioning to 100% clean renewable energy by 2035, expanding public transportation, and strict emission reductions rather than reliance on carbon emission trading.[85] Green New Deal Resolution[edit] Ed Markey speaks on a Green New Deal in front of the Capitol Building in February 2019. Wikisource has original text related to this article: Green New Deal On February 7, 2019, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Edward Markey released a fourteen-page resolution for their Green New Deal (House Resolution 109, closely related to S. Res. 59).[86] Their proposal advocated transitioning the United States to 100% renewable, zero-emission energy sources, along with investment in electric cars and high-speed rail systems, and implementing the \"social cost of carbon\" that had been part of the Obama administration\\'s plan for addressing climate change within 10 years. Besides increasing state-sponsored jobs, this Green New Deal is also sought to address poverty by aiming much of the improvements in \"frontline and vulnerable communities\" which include the poor and disadvantaged people. The resolution included calls for universal health care, increased minimum wages, and preventing monopolies.[87] According to The Washington Post (February 11, 2019), the resolution called for a \"10-year national mobilization\" whose primary goals would be:[88] \"Guaranteeing a job with a family-sustaining wage, adequate family and medical leave, paid vacations, and retirement security to all people of the United States.\" \"Providing all people of the United States with – (i) high-quality health care; (ii) affordable, safe, and adequate housing; (iii) economic security; and (iv) access to clean water, clean air, healthy and affordable food, and nature.\" \"Providing resources, training, and high-quality education, including higher education, to all people of the United States.\" \"Meeting 100 percent of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources.\" \"Repairing and upgrading the infrastructure in the United States, including . . . by eliminating pollution and greenhouse gas emissions as much as technologically feasible.\" \"Building or upgrading to energy-efficient, distributed, and \\'smart\\' power grids, and working to ensure affordable access to electricity.\" \"Upgrading all existing buildings in the United States and building new buildings to achieve maximal energy efficiency, water efficiency, safety, affordability, comfort, and durability, including through electrification.\" \"Overhauling transportation systems in the United States to eliminate pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible, including through investment in – (i) zero-emission vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing; (ii) clean, affordable, and accessible public transportation; and (iii) high-speed rail.\" \"Spurring massive growth in clean manufacturing in the United States and removing pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing and industry as much as is technologically feasible.\" \"Working collaboratively with farmers and ranchers in the United States to eliminate pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector as much as is technologically feasible.\"[89] House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis[edit] Main article: United States House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis Various perspectives emerged in late 2018 as to whether to form a committee dedicated to climate, what powers such a committee might be granted, and whether the committee would be specifically tasked with developing a Green New Deal. Incoming House committee chairs Frank Pallone and Peter DeFazio indicated a preference for handling these matters in the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.[78][90] (Writing in Gentleman\\'s Quarterly, Jay Willis responded that despite the best efforts of Pallone and De Fazio over many years, \"the planet\\'s prognosis has failed to improve,\" providing \"pretty compelling evidence that it is time for legislators to consider taking a different approach.\")[77] In contrast, Representative Ro Khanna thought that creating a Select Committee specifically dedicated to a Green New Deal would be a \"very commonsense idea\", based on the recent example of the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming (2007–2011), which had proven effective in developing a 2009 bill for cap-and-trade legislation.[78][90] Proposals for the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis did not contain \"Green New Deal\" language and lacked the powers desired by Green New Deal proponents, such as the ability to subpoena documents or depose witnesses.[91][92][93] Representative Kathy Castor of Florida was appointed to chair the committee.[93][94] January 2019 letter to Congress from environmental groups[edit] On January 10, 2019, a letter signed by 626 organizations in support of a Green New Deal was sent to all members of Congress. It called for measures such as \"an expansion of the Clean Air Act; a ban on crude oil exports; an end to fossil fuel subsidies and fossil fuel leasing; and a phase-out of all gasoline-powered vehicles by 2040.\"[95][96] The letter also indicated that signatories would \"vigorously oppose ... market-based mechanisms and technology options such as carbon and emissions trading and offsets, carbon capture and storage, nuclear power, waste-to-energy and biomass energy.\"[95] Six major environmental groups did not sign on to the letter: the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Environmental Defense Fund, Mom\\'s Clean Air Force, Environment America, and the Audubon Society.[97] An article in The Atlantic quoted Greg Carlock, who prepared \"a different Green New Deal plan for the left-wing think tank Data for Progress\" as responding, \"There is no scenario produced by the IPCC or the UN where we hit mid-century decarbonization without some kind of carbon capture.\"[95] The MIT Technology Review responded to the letter with an article titled, \"Let\\'s Keep the Green New Deal Grounded in Science\". The MIT article states that, although the letter refers to the \"rapid and aggressive action\" needed to prevent the 1.5 ˚C of warming specified in the UN climate panel\\'s latest report, simply acknowledging the report\\'s recommendation is not sufficient. If the letter\\'s signatories start from a position where the options of carbon pricing, carbon capture for fossil plants, hydropower, and nuclear power, are not even on the table for consideration, there may be no feasible technical means to reach the necessary 1.5 ˚C climate goal.[98] A report in Axios suggested that the letter\\'s omission of a carbon tax, which has been supported by moderate Republicans, did not mean that signatories would oppose carbon pricing.[96][99] The Director of the Center for Science, Technology, and Innovation Policy at George Mason University was quoted as saying, \"As long as organizations hold onto a rigid set of ideas about what the solution is, it\\'s going to be hard to make progress ... And that\\'s what worries me.\"[98] Criticism[edit] Many who support some goals of the Green New Deal express doubt about feasibility of one or more of its parts. John P. Holdren, former science advisor to Obama, thinks the 2030 goal is too optimistic, saying that 2045 or 2050 would be more realistic.[100] Many members of the Green party have also attacked the plan due to its cutting of multiple parts of their plan, such as the elimination of nuclear power and jobs guarantee, and the changing of the goal from a one hundred percent clean, renewable energy economy by 2030 to the elimination of the U.S. carbon footprint by 2030.[63][64] Paul Bledsoe of the Progressive Policy Institute, the think tank affiliated with the conservative Democratic Leadership Council, expressed concern that setting unrealistic \"aspirational\" goals of 100% renewable energy could undermine \"the credibility of the effort\" against climate change.[78] Economist Edward Barbier, who developed the \"Global Green New Deal\" proposal for the United Nations Environment Programme in 2009, opposes \"a massive federal jobs program,\" saying \"The government would end up doing more and more of what the private sector and industry should be doing.\" Barbier prefers carbon pricing, such as a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system, in order to \"address distortions in the economy that are holding back private sector innovation and investments in clean energy.\"[101] When Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) was confronted by youth associated with the Sunrise Movement on why she does not support the Green New Deal, she told them \"there\\'s no way to pay for it\" and that it could not pass a Republican-controlled Senate. In a tweet following the confrontation, Feinstein said that she remains committed \"to enact real, meaningful climate change legislation.\"[102] In February 2019, the center-right American Action Forum, estimated that the plan could cost between $51–$93 trillion over the next decade.[103] They estimate its potential cost at $600,000 per household.[104] The organization estimated the cost for eliminating carbon emissions from the transportation system at $1.3–2.7 trillion; guaranteeing a job to every American $6.8–44.6 trillion; universal health care estimated close to $36 trillion.[105] According to Bloomberg Businessweek, Wall Street is willing to invest significant resources toward GND programs, but not unless Congress commits to moving it forward.[106] The AFL–CIO, in a letter to Ocasio-Cortez, expressed strong reservations about the GND, saying, \"We welcome the call for labor rights and dialogue with labor, but the Green New Deal resolution is far too short on specific solutions that speak to the jobs of our members and the critical sections of our economy.\"[107] In an op-ed for Slate, Alex Baca criticizes the Green New Deal for failing to address the environmental, economic, and social consequences of urban sprawl.[108] Adam Millsap criticizes the GND\\'s overreliance on public transit to make cities more environmentally friendly, since public transit integrates better in monocentric cities than in polycentric ones. He suggests land use reforms to increase density, congestion pricing, and eliminating parking requirements as measures that can be applied more flexibly to cities with monocentric and polycentric layouts.[109] Although the Green New Deal is often presented as a left-wing proposal, criticism of it has come from left-wing commentators who have argued that the Green New Deal fails to tackle the real cause of the climate emergency, namely the concept of unending growth and consumption inherent in capitalism, and is instead an attempt to greenwash capitalism.[110] Left wing critics of the Green New Deal argue that it is not the monetization of Green policies and practices within capitalism that are necessary, but an anti-capitalist adoption of policies for de-growth.[111] Supporters[edit] In September 2019, Naomi Klein published On Fire: The (Burning) Case for a Green New Deal.[112] On Fire is a collection of essays focusing on climate change and the urgent actions needed to preserve the planet. Klein relates her meeting with Greta Thunberg in the opening essay in which she discusses the entrance of young people into those speaking out for climate awareness and change. She supports the Green New Deal throughout the book and in the final essay she discusses the 2020 U.S. election saying \"The stakes of the election are almost unbearably high. It\\'s why I wrote the book and decided to put it out now and why I\\'ll be doing whatever I can to help push people toward supporting a candidate with the most ambitious Green New Deal platform—so that they win the primaries and then the general.\"[113][114][115] Former vice presidents Al Gore[116] Individuals Mike Gravel, former US Senator from Alaska and candidate in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries[117] Howie Hawkins, Green party co-founder and first American political candidate to run on the promise of a Green New Deal[63] Paul Krugman, Nobel laureate in economics, professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, and a columnist for The New York Times[118] Bill Maher, comedian, political commentator, and television host[119] Jill Stein, former Green party presidential candidate in 2012 and 2016[citation needed] Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel laureate in economics, professor at Columbia University, and chief economist of the Roosevelt Institute.[120] Bria Vinaite recorded a \"Green New Deal\" video for Vogue Magazine in 2018[70] Marianne Williamson, candidate in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries[121] Andrew Yang, candidate in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries[122] Senators Richard Blumenthal US Senator from Connecticut[123] Cory Booker, US Senator from New Jersey[124] Kirsten Gillibrand, US Senator from New York[125] Martin Heinrich, US Senator from New Mexico[126] Mazie Hirono, US Senator from Hawaii[127] Amy Klobuchar, US Senator from Minnesota[128] Ed Markey, US Senator from Massachusetts[129] Jeff Merkley, US Senator from Oregon[130] Bernie Sanders, US Senator from Vermont, Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee[131][132] Tom Udall, US Senator from New Mexico[133] Chris Van Hollen, US Senator from Maryland[134] Elizabeth Warren, US Senator from Massachusetts[135] Ron Wyden, US Senator from Oregon[136] Representatives Karen Bass, US Representative from California\\'s 37th congressional district.

It would be great for the so-called \"Carbon Footprint\" to permanently eliminate all Planes, Cars, Cows, Oil, Gas & the Military – even if no other country would do the same. Brilliant!\"[191] Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein objected to the plan saying \"there\\'s no way to pay for it\" and is drafting her own narrowed down version. Democratic Senator Joe Manchin criticized the plan as a \"dream\" adding that \\'it would hurt regions dependent on reliable, affordable energy.\"[192] Republican White House aide Sebastian Gorka has referred to the deal as \"what Stalin dreamed about but never achieved\" and that \"they [proponents of the deal] want to take your pickup truck. They want to rebuild your home. They want to take away your hamburgers.\" The comments about hamburgers are a common criticism of the deal by conservatives, who have gone on to criticize Representative Ocasio-Cortez for allowing her Chief of Staff to eat a hamburger with her at a Washington restaurant.[193] On February 13, 2019, Rep. Mark Walker (R-NC) released a parody video on his verified Twitter account comparing the Green New Deal to the failed Fyre Festival, using the hashtag #GNDisFyre.[194][195] On March 14, 2019, Rep. Rob Bishop, a Republican representing Utah\\'s 1st congressional district, said that the legislation was \"tantamount to genocide,\" adding shortly afterward that his comment was \"maybe an overstatement, but not by a lot.\"[196] During a Fox Business interview on August 13, 2020, President Donald Trump again voiced his opposition, declaring that adopting the Green New Deal would result in demolishing the Empire State Building and abolishing all animals.[197][198] Legislative outcome[edit] On March 26, in what Democrats called a \"stunt,\" Republicans called for an early vote on the resolution without allowing discussion or expert testimony. In protest, 42 Democrats and one Independent who caucuses with Democrats voted \"present\"[199] resulting in a 57–0 defeat on the Senate floor. Three Democrats and one Independent who caucuses with Democrats voted against the bill, while the other votes were along party lines.[200] 2020 presidential campaign[edit] Howie Hawkins, the Green Party\\'s 2020 presidential candidate, ran on a Green New Deal platform calling for the U.S. to reach zero greenhouse emissions and 100% clean energy by 2030.[9] Democratic Party presidential candidate and president-elect Joe Biden has declined to endorse the full Green New Deal plan proposed by members of his party, but he has promised to increase generation of renewable energy, transition to more energy efficient buildings and increase fuel efficiency standards for automobiles.[201] The joint policy proposals developed by the Biden and Sanders campaigns, which were released on July 8, 2020, do not include a Green New Deal.[202] The Biden climate plan[edit] In 2021, commentators noted that early climate-related executive actions by President Biden, such as re-joining the Paris Agreement, have much in common with the 2019 GND proposed by Rep. Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Markey. According to Mike Krancer, while he sees the Biden Plan For A Clean Energy Revolution And Environmental Justice and the 2019 proposal as very similar, a key difference is that the Biden plan includes a prominent role for carbon capture and storage technology.[203][204][32] President Biden\\'s infrastructure package, which pledges to halve 2005 U.S. greenhouse gas emissions levels by 2030,[205] has been criticized by progressives, including Rep. Ocasio-Cortez, as not being ambitious enough to achieve the scale required to mitigate climate change.[206] Biden\\'s climate plan is incorporated in his American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan, which would in part lead to the creation of a Civilian Climate Corps modeled after the Civilian Conservation Corps.[207] 2021 reintroduction[edit] On April 20, 2021, Rep. Ocasio-Cortez, Sen. Markey and fellow Democratic lawmakers reintroduced the Green New Deal Resolution at the National Mall. The resolution reaffirms the threat produced by climate change and the responsibility of the US to recommit to meeting the emission goals outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.[208] The Red Deal[edit] In April 2021, The Red Nation Indigenous advocacy group released the Red Deal. The Red Deal is a proposal designed to supplement the Green New Deal, and incorporates a range of anti-capitalism and Indigenous decolonisation proposals designed to halt climate change.[209][210] International[edit] After the Green New Deal idea was floated by Thomas Friedman in 2007 and developed by the British Green New Deal Group, a plan for an international green new deal was advanced by the United Nations. On October 22, 2008, UNEP\\'s Executive Director Achim Steiner unveiled a Global Green New Deal initiative as a response to the financial crisis of 2008, aiming to create jobs in \"green\" industries, thus boosting the world economy and curbing climate change at the same time.[211] The UN continued to promote the global green new deal into 2009 both to the G20[212] and its wider membership.[213] The International green new deal was also supported by Gordon Brown.[214] Yet despite the success of Brown and others in bringing about a short lived worldwide return to Keynesian stimulus policies, the focus of extra government spending was on supporting existing economic activity, rather than speeding the transition to the green economy. In 2019, United Nations officials and others once again called for a global green new deal.[215] In July 2021, the Global Alliance for a Green New Deal was launched, a group of politicians from around the world campaigning for an international Green New Deal.[216] See also[edit] Adaptation to global warming Climate change mitigation Economics of global warming Environmental policy of the United States Energy transition European Green Deal Green capitalism Green economy Green growth Just Transition Politics of global warming Prosperity Without Growth Sunrise Movement References[edit] ^ Jeremy Lovell (July 21, 2008) \"Climate report calls for green \\'New Deal\\'\" Archived June 10, 2020, at the Wayback Machine, Reuters. ^ A Green New Deal: Discursive Review and Appraisal.

            "Question: Does the new Arizona abortion ban include exceptions that allow abortion in cases of rape or incest?\n",
            "Answer: Based on the consistent information provided across multiple documents, the revived 1864 territorial abortion ban in Arizona does not include any exceptions that would allow for abortion in cases of rape or incest. The key evidence showing this lack of exceptions is:  The Associated Press article states directly that the 1864 law Arizona must now follow \"provides no exceptions for rape or incest.\" Another AP article titled \"What to know about abortion in Arizona under the near-total 1864 ban\" also explicitly says \"The law predating Arizona's statehood provides no exceptions for rape or incest.\" CNN reports that the Arizona Supreme Court ruled the state must adhere to the 1864 law \"that bans all abortions except those necessary to save the mother's life\", implying no allowances for rape/incest cases. The CBS News article notes the ruling \"clears the way for a near-total ban on abortions in the state\", suggesting no broad exceptions beyond imminent life threats. Time magazine states the 1864 law bans \"all abortions, except those necessary to save a woman's life\", leaving out any mention of rape/incest provisions. Multiple sources use phrasing like \"near-total ban\" and \"almost all abortions\" when describing the 1864 Arizona law, indicative of extremely limited exceptions overall.  So in summary, the documents consistently and explicitly state that the antiquated 1864 abortion ban revived in Arizona lacks any provisions or exceptions to allow for abortion in pregnancies resulting from rape or incest situations. The sole allowance cited is for cases directly threatening the mother's life.\n",
            "\n",
            "Question: How does the Arizona abortion ban treat pregnant women who are victims of rape or incest?\n",
            "Answer: According to the information provided across the documents, the revived 1864 territorial abortion ban in Arizona does not make any exceptions to allow abortions for pregnant women who are victims of rape or incest. The evidence clearly showing the lack of rape/incest exceptions is:  The CBS News video report states the 1864 ban ruled enforceable by the Arizona Supreme Court \"does not provide exceptions for rape and incest.\" The Associated Press articles bluntly state that the 1864 law \"provides no exceptions for rape or incest.\" Another AP article titled \"What to know about abortion in Arizona under the near-total 1864 ban\" reiterates that the law explicitly \"provides no exceptions for rape or incest.\" CNN's coverage notes Arizona must now follow a law \"that bans all abortions except those necessary to save the mother's life\", excluding rape/incest cases. Multiple sources describe it as a \"near-total ban\" or rules allowing abortion only to preserve the mother's life, indicating no broader allowances. No document reviewed cites any provisions in the draconian 1864 law to permit abortions in cases where the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest.  So in summary, the provided information from credible news sources consistently and explicitly confirms that the antiquated Arizona law does not include any exceptions to allow for abortion in cases where the woman is pregnant as a result of rape or incestuous situations. The lack of such allowances is a key aspect of why the revived 1864 ban is characterized as so severely restrictive.\n",
            "\n",
            "Question: What provisions, if any, are made under the Arizona abortion law for pregnancy termination resulting from rape or incestuous situations?\n",
            "Answer: Based on the consistent information provided across the various documents, the revived 1864 territorial abortion ban in Arizona does not make any provisions or exceptions to allow for abortion or pregnancy termination resulting from rape or incestuous situations. The key evidence showing the complete lack of rape/incest exceptions is:  Multiple sources, including CBS News, NPR, and NBC News, explicitly state that the 1864 law allows abortions only to save the life of the pregnant woman/patient, with no other exceptions cited. The CBS video report directly says the reinstated 1864 ban \"does not provide exceptions for rape and incest.\" CNN notes Arizona must now follow a law \"that bans all abortions except those necessary to save the mother's life\", excluding rape/incest cases. Time magazine similarly reports the decision means \"all abortions, except those necessary to save a woman's life, are illegal\" under the 1864 law. Stateline's coverage states the ruling \"reinstating a 160-year-old law that forbids all procedures except those necessary to save the mother's life.\" Descriptions like \"near-total ban\" are repeatedly used, suggesting no broader allowances beyond imminent life preservation. No document reviewed mentions any provisions in the antiquated 1864 Arizona law to permit abortions or terminations in pregnancies caused by rape or incest.  So in summary, the information provided by credible news sources unanimously and unambiguously confirms that the severely restrictive 1864 abortion ban lacks any exceptions or provisions to allow for termination of pregnancies resulting from rape or incestuous situations in Arizona. The sole allowance is to preserve the pregnant woman's life.\n",
