To improve prison conditions and attract more staff, state lawmakers passed a pay raise for state employees last summer that boosted starting wages for corrections officers to $33 an hour. Wages could be as high as $41 an hour depending on location and shift. On Feb. 11 on WISN-TV’s ""Upfront"" program, Gov. Tony Evers claimed the pay raise is helping attract more people to the profession and producing record-high officer training classes. ""We're having the largest classes of correctional officers we've ever had before,"" Evers said. However, Evers acknowledges that large class sizes haven’t yet solved the staffing shortages, saying, ""We’re getting there."" Sign up for PolitiFact texts The Wisconsin Department of Corrections said its training program for correctional officers has had a spike in graduates over the past six months. But is Evers correct that recent classes have been the largest ever? And, since Evers suggested they were making a major dent in shortages, we’ll touch on how the graduates stack up against soaring high vacancy rates. Correctional officer training program sees increased graduates People interested in becoming correctional officers must undergo a six-week training academy called the Facility Staff Training and Support Program before they can start security work at prisons across the state. The program is held at the Department of Corrections’ training center in Madison or at local academies, which currently are held at Green Bay Correctional Institution and Dodge Correctional Institution. A Feb. 21 graduation ceremony at Madison College for newly certified corrections officers had 214 graduates, according to the Department of Corrections. In a Department of Corrections press release, Secretary Kevin Carr said that was the department’s largest graduating class since at least 1981. The previous graduating class on Dec. 15 had 144 graduates. Graduate numbers have been increasing. In 2023, the state saw 568 graduates from multiple training classes, and in 2022, the total was 285 graduates, according to the Department of Corrections. Department of Corrections data shows staffing shortages shrinking Staffing vacancies for all state prisons reached a peak of 35% last August and have since been trending down, according to Department of Corrections data. Shortages have been especially tight at Waupun and Green Bay Correctional Institutions, where inmates’ movement has been limited since March and June because of low staffing. After the pay raise took effect in October, vacancies started trending down and currently sit at 26%. But that is still a relatively high vacancy rate for the prisons. Pre-pandemic rates consistently sat around 15% and didn’t go above 20%. In his interview, Evers mentions the pay bump has helped statewide staffing shortages, but places such as Waupun—where the vacancy rate is 56%—are still struggling. Our ruling During a TV interview, Evers claimed pay raises for correctional officers had led to ""the largest classes of correctional officers we've ever had before."" The governor acknowledged that conditions aren’t perfect yet and work remains to solve prison and staffing conditions. In February, the Department of Corrections graduated its largest training class to date with 214 graduates and the last class had 144 graduates. And as graduating classes increase, staffing shortages at state prisons are trending down after peaking last summer. We rate this claim True."

And a New York state legislator recently touted the lakes’ importance to the continent’s and the world’s water supply. New York State Assembly member Patrick Burke, whose Buffalo-area district almost touches Lake Erie, introduced a bill this month that would create a ""Great Lakes Bill of Rights"" to give residents ""a role in the decision-making process regarding current and future projects that impact the ecosystem."" In a press release introducing the bill, Burke wrote that the Great Lakes account for ""over 20% of the world’s freshwater and over 80% of North America’s freshwater."" Official data says Burke is correct. Burke’s office did not answer a request for comment. Sign up for PolitiFact texts How great are the lakes? Besides Erie and Ontario, the Great Lakes include Superior, Michigan and Huron to the west. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Great Lakes account for 21% of the world’s freshwater and 84% of North America's surface fresh water. That’s in line with what Burke said. Such percentages may sound like a lot, but Joseph Atkinson, the director for the Great Lakes Program at the University at Buffalo, told PolitiFact that even such large reserves cannot last indefinitely without careful conservation. ""if you start diverting the water from the Great Lakes to other areas of the U.S., depending on how much is moved, they won’t be able to provide as much fresh water as they would if the water remained where it was,"" Atkinson said. If the water being removed ""exceeds the water coming in, the water levels will drop indefinitely."" Besides providing fresh drinking water, the Great Lakes provide energy through hydroelectric power. The Robert Moses Niagara Hydroelectric Power Station and the Lewiston Pump Generating Plant are New York State’s two largest hydroelectric power plants, according to the New York Power Authority. Both are near Niagara Falls, which is formed by the Niagara River; the Niagara River carries water from Lake Erie into Lake Ontario. ""The hydroelectric power plant at Niagara Falls was one of the first in the country, and it's still a pretty large contributor to New York's power supply,"" Atkinson said. Conservation efforts The Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, signed April 15, 1972, involved pledges by Canada and the United States to protect the Great Lakes. The agreement sets limits on phosphorus levels flowing into the lakes. Too much phosphorus would make the lakes subject to too much growth by algae and other invasive plants, Atkinson said. ""It's very important to conserve the Great Lakes,"" Atkinson said. The lakes, he said, ""are essential to our existence."" Our ruling Burke said the Great Lakes account for ""over 20% of the world’s freshwater and over 80% of North America’s freshwater."" The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says the Great Lakes account for 21% of the world’s freshwater and 84% of North America's surface fresh water. That’s in line with what Burke said.

,TRUE,Sarah Godlewski,"“When it comes to how many votes (President) Joe Biden won, it was literally less than a few votes per ward.”",,2024-03-03,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/mar/28/sarah-godlewski/did-the-2020-presidential-election-in-wisconsin-re/,,"At a rally in suburban Waukesha earlier this month, first lady Jill Biden and other Democratic officials laid out what’s at stake in the 2024 election, focusing on abortion and health care access. Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski was one of the speakers who took the stage before the first lady, asking a crowd of mostly women voters to talk to their neighbors and help get out the vote. ""When it comes to how many votes (President) Joe Biden won, it was literally less than a few votes per ward,"" Godlewski said. We often mention that Biden won Wisconsin in 2020 by a little more than 20,000 votes. But taking a look at the votes by ward could give an interesting picture of how competitive the election was – and could be again this fall. And other Democrats seem to be repeating the same message, including when Biden visited his new campaign headquarters in Milwaukee. Sign up for PolitiFact texts ""In Wisconsin, every election comes down to three to four votes per ward,"" the state party’s Deputy Organizing Director Jaliah Jefferson said at that event. As the state heads for a rematch between Biden and former President Donald Trump, let’s look at how many votes it came down to by ward last time. Number came from dividing votes by total number of wards in Wisconsin When we asked for backup, Nathan Schwantes, Godlewski’s chief of staff, said the secretary of state was talking about the entire state of Wisconsin, not a specific city or county. He explained that Biden won the state by 20,682 votes (which is correct) and that Wisconsin had 6,656 wards where voters lived. That division results in 3.1 votes per ward. He added that there’s a slightly different count of wards in Wisconsin, which includes wards where no voters live. That number was 7,078, giving a result of 2.9 voters. State law says that wards are the ""building blocks"" for creating districts for local, state and federal offices. And ""all territory, even if unpopulated, must be contained in a ward."" That explains why some wards might not actually have voters in them. Schwantes shared an email from the nonpartisan Legislative Technology Services Bureau, which confirms the 7,078 number. That total was from July, because the next count was not taken until January. Whichever total ward number is used, the calculations result in around a few votes per ward. So, Godlewski’s math is correct. Calculation takes wards together as an average, though certain areas voted differently Wards vary widely in population. And blue areas of the state would have delivered many more votes for Biden per ward, and red areas would have delivered much less. For example, Biden lost Waukesha County to Trump — where Godlewski made the claim — by 55,743 votes. Looking at the ward-by-ward report of 2020 presidential results, Waukesha County had about 387 wards, so that comes down to about 144 votes per ward that Biden lost by. The similar claim, from Jefferson, simply said that elections in Wisconsin come down to a few votes per ward — not that Biden specifically won or lost those few votes everywhere. For comparison, in Milwaukee County — where Jefferson made her claim — Biden won over Trump by 183,045 votes. Milwaukee County had about 572 wards, coming down to about 320 votes per ward that Biden won by. Counties use ""reporting units"" to report results, which can be one ward or a group of wards. So, our analysis of those counties is an estimate and includes wards where no voters live — there are many like that in the City of Waukesha. Biden certainly didn’t win — or lose — by three votes per ward in every county, but it is the right average. It’s clear that Godlewski was speaking generally about the entire state. And presidents are elected based on how many electoral votes the entire state has, not by counties or wards. Our ruling At a Waukesha rally, Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski said ""when it comes to how many votes Joe Biden won, it was literally less than a few votes per ward."" Although ""less than a few"" is open to interpretation, 2.9 or 3.1 is certainly a small number, considering that several hundred voters can live in one ward. And although her claim doesn’t require a caveat because presidents are elected statewide, we should still note that Biden’s vote-per-ward margin would have been larger or smaller in certain areas of the state. We rate her claim True."

,TRUE,Tammy Baldwin,“We’re facing situations these days where you have to have two officers in the evidence room in case there’s an accidental (fentanyl) exposure.”,,2024-03-07,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/mar/29/tammy-baldwin/yes-many-wisconsin-police-agencies-have-two-office/,,"U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin spoke about the fentanyl crisis in a March 7 media call ahead of the State of the Union, alongside the Waukesha police chief, who attended President Joe Biden’s speech with Baldwin. Fentanyl is an extremely powerful synthetic opioid, known for its ability to kill in small doses. The drug is commonly mixed into drugs such as heroin and cocaine, but can also be found in pressed pills and even in marijuana, police say. PolitiFact has looked at claims regarding fentanyl and accidental overdoses before, when envelopes containing unknown substances were sent to elections officials in 2023. According to a Nov. 10, 2023, fact-check, although fentanyl is dangerous, and it can be lethal in small doses, it must enter the bloodstream to have an effect. The drug isn’t absorbed well by the skin, meaning it must be snorted through the nose, ingested or injected with a needle. People also cannot get sick by being in a room with powdered fentanyl, because it doesn’t easily vaporize. A source in the fact check said to cause toxicity from breathing it in, ""You would probably have to be in a wind tunnel with dunes of fentanyl around you."" Sign up for PolitiFact texts But people can get sick if they touch the drug and then touch their mouth, nose or eyes. In 2022, there were over 1,400 opioid-related deaths in Wisconsin, many of them tied to fentanyl, according to a February 2024 PolitiFact. During the call, Baldwin made a claim that initially had us — and probably others — scratching our heads: ""We’re facing situations these days where you have to have two officers in the evidence room in case there’s an accidental (fentanyl) exposure. We are facing situations where first responders have been exposed to fentanyl at the crime scene and that is scary and we need to provide the support, the tools, the test strips, and all the training necessary to keep our first responders safe so that they can keep all of us safe."" Why would two officers need to be present to test a drug? Is it a safety precaution or something else? Many agencies have policies to have two officers present during drug analysis When we asked Baldwin’s team about the claim, press secretary Alanna Conley pointed us toward the Sheboygan County Sheriff’s Department, which recently shared its policies with Baldwin. Sheriff Cory Roeseler said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin that several years ago someone was exposed during testing of a suspected narcotic, which ended up having fentanyl in it. ""As a result our testing procedure changed. First we started using two officers, one in the room where the drugs are being tested and one outside the room in the event that there was an exposure,"" he said. ""Second we purchased a specific chamber to use to test the drugs so that it might limit any potential exposure and this chamber is vented/filtered. Lastly, we have Narcan readily available in our testing area in the event that there was an exposure where it might be needed."" He said there have been exposures for at least one deputy, who was transporting a drug in to be processed, and another for a corrections officer, who was exposed during booking and had to be hospitalized. The Sheboygan sheriff’s department isn’t the only agency that uses two people when narcotics are being handled. Jim Palmer, a member of the Board of Directors for the Wisconsin Law Enforcement Accreditation Group, said in an email that ""the practice of having two individuals work in an evidence room as a safety precaution has become increasingly common."" He said that a second person can be used in handling certain types of dangerous evidence, according to standards created by the group. The standards also recommend the use of gloves, a respirator, a fume hood and having naloxone available. Palmer pointed to the Madison Police Department, whose guidance takes the standards into account. According to the department’s document on handling evidence and contraband, ""the best practice is to be paired up with at least one other officer."" ""The second ‘safety officer’ will not be directly involved in the testing, handling or packaging of the drug, but can perform other support functions such as computer entries."" Waukesha Police Capt. Dan Baumann said his department handles drugs similarly, given that so many different substances can be cut with fentanyl. There is the evidence room, and within that, there is a smaller processing room about the size of an office bathroom. In that smaller room, there’s a hood providing a gentle amount of filtered air. ""An officer that would stand outside the room, and then an officer that stands on the inside of the room that’s actually collecting and packaging the evidence, testing it, weighing it and all that fun stuff,"" Baumann said in a phone call with PolitiFact Wisconsin. There is also Narcan on hand, in case there is a large enough exposure. ""Somebody with medical training is going to be present with you, just in case something were to happen,"" he said. ""We’re going to take all precautionary measures."" The Milwaukee Police Department has a similar policy, according to its controlled substances procedures: ""The ‘buddy system’ shall always be used when testing suspected controlled substances, regardless of the type or quantity. Two members shall be present, one to test and one to witness,"" the procedures document says. Our ruling Baldwin said police are ""facing situations these days where you have to have two officers in the evidence room in case there’s an accidental (fentanyl) exposure."" In Wisconsin, there is guidance from the Wisconsin Law Enforcement Accreditation Group to have two officers present, and several agencies have guidance calling for one officer inside the room where drugs are being handled and tested, and another stands outside to ensure the other is safe. We rate this claim as True."

Using the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification system, the report estimated that from mid-March to mid-July, 1.1 million people — about half of the Gazan population — will face ""catastrophic"" food insecurity, when starvation, death and ""extremely critical acute malnutrition levels"" are evident. From Feb. 15 to March 15, the report said, 677,000 people in Gaza faced ""catastrophic"" levels of food insecurity. The Israel-Hamas war and ""extremely limited"" access for humanitarian groups to provide aid within Gaza are driving the hunger crisis, the report said. (Screenshot from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification’s Special Brief: The Gaza Strip Acute Food Insecurity Analysis March 2024 report.) Guterres’ statement is specific and accurate. We found no instances since the tracking system’s creation about two decades ago in which more people in one place were classified as experiencing ""catastrophic"" hunger or famine. At the same time, his statement might have left some listeners, particularly those unfamiliar with this 20-year-old global tracking system, wondering how the Gaza situation compares with other hunger crises throughout history. We contacted Guterres and a spokesperson with the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification system and received no reply. Data and experts backed Guterres’ statement. Ron Dermer, minister for strategic affairs in Israel, on March 26 disputed the report of imminent famine. The global food insecurity evaluation system The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification system Guterres referred to, created in 2004, is used to classify ""the severity and magnitude of food insecurity and malnutrition"" globally. The system, sometimes called IPC, is described as the main tool the international community uses to analyze data and determine whether famine is happening or projected to occur in a country. In January, Arif Husain, the United Nations World Food Program chief economist, explained how IPC analysis reports are produced. ""This is an exercise that has about 23 partners, including 19 U.N. agencies and international (nongovernmental organizations) and about four donors,"" Husain told The New Yorker. He said the group’s findings are independent and a consensus-based analysis. When have the worst levels of food insecurity been reported? The IPC’s system classifies acute food insecurity in five phases, with 1 meaning ""none/minimal,"" to 5, meaning ""catastrophe/famine."" Since the system’s creation, food insecurity levels have rarely reached phase 5 in any country. The IPC’s ""catastrophic"" phase 5 classification applies to households experiencing extreme lack of food. A phase 5 ""famine"" classification applies to an area in which at least 1 in 5 households face ""catastrophic"" food insecurity, and malnutrition and mortality are acute. IPC has classified two situations in the last 10 years as ""famine"": In 2011, in parts of southern Somalia about 490,000 people experienced catastrophic food insecurity because of conflict and drought. In 2017, almost 80,000 people in parts of South Sudan faced acute food insecurity because of three years of civil war, economic hardship and high food prices. Somalia was the ""clearest case in recent decades,"" and ""Gaza has surpassed those numbers today,"" wrote Alex de Waal, the World Peace Foundation executive director, following the March IPC report’s release. In January, de Waal said the IPC phase 5 designation ""is exceptional and rare."" Based on the information we could find, 677,000 people facing catastrophic hunger, as the report said they are in Gaza, is unprecedented. We searched Google and Nexis, a database of news reports, and found other instances in which acute food insecurity reached phase 5 catastrophic levels, even if the IPC did not designate a famine. These included: In June 2021, 353,000 people in Ethiopia. (The Ethiopian government disputed the analysis.) In March 2022, 31,000 people in Yemen. In May 2022, 20,000 people in Afghanistan. In October 2022, 19,000 people in Haiti. In November 2023, 35,000 people in South Sudan. Beth Bechdol, the Food and Agriculture Organization’s deputy director general, told The Washington Post that, as of the March report, Gaza has the largest percentage of a population to receive its most severe rating since the IPC began reporting in 2004. The report said 30% of Gaza’s population is currently in phase 5. The World Peace Foundation’s de Waal, who wrote the book ""Mass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine,"" told PolitiFact that someone would have to look back to before World War II to find incidents of food insecurity ""of comparable intensity."" ""The absolute numbers of people who will die in Gaza’s catastrophe will not match the great and calamitous famines of the 20th century, solely because the afflicted population is smaller,"" he wrote in January. ""The proportionate death toll may be comparable."" A nurse cares for premature babies March 8, 2024, in a hospital in Rafah, Gaza Strip. Sixteen premature babies have died of malnutrition-related causes over the past five weeks at the hospital, a senior doctor told The Associated Press. (AP) The classification scale’s limitations The IPC system has been used in at least 30 countries but is not used everywhere — so it has not designated catastrophic hunger or famine in places such as Syria, where conflict has caused significant food insecurity for millions of people. And the most dire situations are also those in which data is hardest to gather, said Erin Lentz, a University of Texas public affairs professor who studies food insecurity. In Gaza, ""it’s really difficult to get a handle on what’s happening with mortality rates,"" which is a component of a famine classification, Lentz said. The Sudan situation is similar, she said. Conflict between Sudan’s military and a violent paramilitary group has put the country at risk of becoming the world’s largest hunger crisis, according to the U.N. IPC classifications, which require a group of analysts to reach consensus, also take time, Lentz said. ""So not only is it hard to collect data, but in places like Gaza and in Sudan, the situation is so dynamic, the data are often out of date pretty quickly,"" she said. Palestinians crowd together Nov. 8, 2023, as they wait for food distribution in Rafah, southern Gaza Strip. (AP) Other famines, some that predated the IPC The World Food Program said five famines have been declared since the mid-1980s, four of them before the IPC system was created: A 1984 Ethiopia famine killed an estimated 400,000 to 1 million people. Beginning in 1992, a Somalia famine killed more than 200,000 people. In the mid-1990s, a North Korea famine is estimated to have killed between 200,000 and 1 million people. In 2000, the Somali region of Ethiopia experienced famine, but mortality data was scarce. Parts of southern Sudan faced famine in 2008. We could not find information about whether these parts of Sudan were classified as facing phase 5 ""catastrophic"" hunger. The earliest analysis on the IPC’s website is from 2011 and we found no news reports stating whether the classification system was used in 2008. Our ruling Guterres said Gaza has ""the highest number of people facing catastrophic hunger ever recorded"" by the IPC system ""anywhere, anytime."" He’s right about the IPC system’s data. A March report using the IPC system found that 677,000 Gazans currently face catastrophic acute food insecurity and projected that 1.1 million people are expected to face such acute food insecurity from March 16 to July 15. It’s worth noting that the IPC system is not used in every country. But we found no instances in which more than 677,000 people were classified as experiencing ""catastrophic"" hunger or famine in any one location since the system’s creation in 2004. Guterres’ statement is accurate, so we rate it True. PolitiFact Researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report."

Although there has been money set aside — a $125 million trust fund — to address the growing number of communities and homeowners impacted by PFAS, Republicans and Democrats disagree over how best to release the money to the state Department of Natural Resources for spending. Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, wants the department to decide how to best spend the money to help residents. Meanwhile, Republicans say they want a clear spending plan for the money, created through legislation. Over the last several months, Evers has continually called for the release of the PFAS trust fund to the Department of Natural Resources, so the agency can focus on solving issues being caused by the chemicals. But with that call for release has also come controversy, as pointed out by state Sen. Van Wanggaard, R-Racine, in April 15 on X. Sign up for PolitiFact texts ""Do you think he realizes that he’s using the fact that he vetoed how to spend the money to ask that we give him the money anyways?"" the post said. Wanggaard’s post was meant as a comment on a previous post by Evers, in which the governor again called on the Legislature to ""release these funds and get this important work done for folks and families across our state."" But let’s look at Wanggaard’s claim – basically, he’s saying that Evers is asking the GOP to release money for PFAS, but ""vetoed (a bill outlining) how to spend the money."" Is that true? PFAS have faced a partisan battle When asked for backup, a Wanggaard spokesperson declined to share any information about the claim. But plenty of information already exists, so let’s dive in. PFAS, polyfluoroalkyl substances, are widely used, long-lasting synthetic chemicals found in a wide array of consumer products including stain-resistant carpet, waterproof clothing and nonstick cookware. They’re called ""forever chemicals"" because they’re nearly indestructible — they don’t dissolve in water and break down slowly. Scientific studies have linked exposure to some PFAS in the environment to harmful health effects in humans and animals. In April, Evers did veto a bill created by Republicans that outlined how they thought the $125 million trust fund should be spent. Issuing the veto, of course, is Evers’ prerogative. The bill included a provision that some believe could harm the Department of Natural Resources ’ authority to address PFAS contamination, and another targeted at ""innocent landowners"" that environmental advocates worried would excuse some PFAS manufacturers and users from having to take responsibility for a contamination. Officials with the department, Evers and Republican bill authors met several times throughout the drafting process and the amendment process, but did not reach a compromise, according to an Oct. 11, 2023, report from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Republicans have insisted that the veto also blocks them from releasing the funds currently held in the trust fund, the Journal Sentinel report said. Republicans voted along party lines to override Evers’ veto, but the Assembly — also controlled by Republicans — has offered no indication it will schedule its own vote. So, the matter has been left in limbo. Evers has repeatedly asked the Legislature to release the money. He even tried to call in the Joint Finance Committee to release the funding and his administration submitted several draft plans to the panel that outlined how the money could be spent without further legislation. On May 7, 2023, for example, the committee released funding from the national opioid settlement agreement, after altering the Department of Health Service’s submitted plan, according to the Journal Sentinel. But the committee twice refused to hold a vote. Republican leaders on the committee said the panel can’t hold a vote to release the funding, because ""it would be essentially ignoring the governor’s veto on the bill spending the money,"" a May 14, 2024 report from the Journal Sentinel said. Leadership also suggested that releasing the funding after the veto could open the Legislature up to legal action. Our ruling Wanggaard claimed that despite the governor’s calls for Republicans to release the PFAS ""trust fund,"" Evers ""vetoed (a bill outlining) how to spend the money."" Evers in April 2024 did veto a Republican-authored bill that outlined how the money could be spent, and created new programs to aid in cleaning up PFAS and protecting ""innocent landowners"" from being held liable for contamination on their property. Of course, Evers isn’t obligated to agree to the Republican plan, any more than Republicans on the Joint Finance Committee are obligated to sign off on his administration’s plans to let the DNR spend the PFAS trust fund. And without some sort of agreement between Republicans and Democrats, Wisconsin is unlikely to see the PFAS funding released to communities. We rate this claim Mostly True. While Wanggaard’s statement is accurate, it needs clarification or additional information."

U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Wis., called out U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., on abortion in an interview on UpFront on WISN-TV in April. When asked about Donald Trump’s position on abortion, Steil said: ""At the national level what we’re often talking about is whether taxpayer dollars should be used. You have someone like Tammy Baldwin that believes taxpayer dollars should be used for abortion. And somebody like me that comes down on the side of life."" To be clear, Baldwin is running against Republican Eric Hovde, a madison businessman, not Steil, who is in his own race against Democrat Peter Barca. Sign up for PolitiFact texts But is Steil right that Baldwin supports using taxpayer money for abortions? Baldwin votes related to abortion When we asked Steil’s office for evidence, his staff noted that Baldwin voted against the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act in January 2019. Baldwin’s vote contributed to the measure failing in the Senate. A January 2019 story from Politico called the vote on the legislation ""a largely symbolic effort timed to coincide with the country’s largest annual anti-abortion demonstration in Washington."" Asked if Baldwin supported tax dollars paying for abortions, Baldwin campaign spokesman Andrew Mamo did not answer the question directly, stating only Baldwin ""will always vote to support womens’ freedom to make their own health care decisions."" Meanwhile, Steil’s office also pointed us to two amendments in 2021 proposed by U.S. Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., related to the potential use of taxpayer dollars for abortions that Baldwin voted against. But in the way Washington operates, there can be many reasons for a no vote – from opposition to cost to other items in the measure, or as a response to political maneuvering. Baldwin introduces bill on ‘reproductive health travel’ Finally, Steil’s office also pointed to Baldwin introducing a bill in the Senate dubbed the Reproductive Health Travel Fund Act of 2023. According to the text of the bill, the measure would ""authorize grants to eligible entities to pay for travel-related expenses and logistical support for individuals seeking abortion services, and for other purposes."" The proposed legislation offers funding for organizations that work with pregnant women on things such as travel, meals, logistics, childcare, patient education and even doula care. It’s clear by its own description that taxpayer funds could be used to help people who are trying to get an abortion. However, the bill also states that ""an eligible entity receiving a grant under this section shall not use the grant for costs of an abortion procedure."" So, it’s far from as clear cut as Steil tried to make it. Our ruling Steil claimed Baldwin ""believes taxpayer dollars should be used for abortion."" His office pointed to several bills and amendments related to abortion as evidence, but none are directly on point. The central piece of evidence he cited is a bill Baldwin introduced that would provide funding for travel costs and other aspects of reproductive healthcare, including access to abortion —but the same bill specifically states the federal funding cannot be used for an abortion procedure. Baldwin, meanwhile, does not help her own case, in that a spokesperson did not directly answer if the senator was in favor of taxpayer funds paying for abortions. Our definition of Half True is ""the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context."" That fits here."

PolitiFact National did an earlier fact-check on the Biden administration’s statements on Black entrepreneurs from the fact sheet and rated it True. Census Bureau and the Federal Reserve Board datasets found record levels of Black business ownership in 2021 and 2022. Independent analyses say that some of Biden’s policies likely played a role. PolitiFact cited a Brookings Institution analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau’s Annual Business Survey that showed the number of Black-owned businesses with more than one employee has increased every year since 2017. In the same fact-check, PolitiFact cited the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances from 2022. It reported that 11% of Black households held equity in a business. When PolitiFact contacted the Biden administration for comment for its fact-check, the White House ""shared independent analyses suggesting that some Biden policies helped spur these increases."" The analyses in question focused on changes the Biden administration made to a pandemic-era initiative, the Paycheck Protection Program, which lent money to small businesses that needed it.

An economic impact of $94 million is the early projection. That boom isn’t lost on Wisconsin politicians, especially Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who has frequently hyped up a ""record-breaking year"" for tourism in posts on X, the site formerly known as Twitter. Sign up for PolitiFact texts ""Wisconsin saw another record-breaking year for tourism, with a historic $25 billion economic impact in 2023,"" Evers posted June 11. ""That blows 2022's record year out of the water."" On June 22, Evers also called out ""Wisconsin's record-breaking year for tourism"" and credited outdoor recreation opportunities. PolitiFact Wisconsin was interested in these numbers, because tourism will surely continue to be a hot topic in Wisconsin in the months ahead. $25 billion is clearly a large number, but what goes into the formula to generate that economic impact? Is it spread throughout the state, or only in cities? And how does it compare to past years? In short, is Evers right that it’s record-breaking? Let’s take a look. Outside report calculates visitor spending and other variables to reach $25 billion number The $25 billion number Evers is referring to comes from the Tourism Economics Report, which is available on the Wisconsin Department of Tourism website. The report was created by Tourism Economics — a company of global advisory firm Oxford Economics — not the state itself. The methodology explains the firm used a model to trace the ""flow of visitor-related expenditures through the state’s economy and their effects on employment, wages, and taxes."" Visitors were considered people who stayed overnight on a trip or traveled more than 50 miles to a destination. Multiple data sources were used, such as from surveys and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. With that said, let’s take a closer look at how they calculated the $25 billion total impact. A large portion of that number — $15.7 billion — comes from direct visitor spending on things like lodging, food and beverage, retail, entertainment and transportation. Then there’s about $4.6 billion in what’s called supply-chain effects, such as needing to purchase more from food wholesalers and utilities. Finally, there’s $4.7 billion in ""induced impacts"" — which refers to wages that are generated directly or indirectly by visitor spending and spent in the local economy. That gives a picture of what goes into the $25 billion: It’s more than just the raw amount that visitors are spending in Wisconsin. Is that impact equally felt in the state? The tourism department said all of Wisconsin’s 72 counties saw an increase in their total economic impact number from 2022 to 2023. A spreadsheet of county-level data confirms that. The top five counties with the highest economic impact, in millions, were Milwaukee, Dane, Sauk, Waukesha and Brown. Interestingly, popular tourism destination Door County ranked eighth at $620 million, far below Milwaukee’s $4.17 billion. The counties with the lowest economic impact from tourism were Menominee, Florence, Pepin, Forest and Lafayette. Those ranged from $6 million to $29 million in impacts. The counties that saw the highest growth in their total economic impact from 2022 to 2023 were Monroe, Menominee, and Green Lake. They saw increases from 10 to 11 percent each. Bottom line: All counties experienced growth in 2023, though some counties clearly benefit more from tourism than others. Records often set each year, with COVID-19 pandemic as an exception Let’s go back to the part of Evers’ claim about 2023 being a ""record-breaking year."" The tourism department has said the $25 billion last year broke a record, surpassing the previous record of $23.7 billion set in 2022. That increase is above the rate of inflation, too. There’s a history of setting a new tourism record every year, at least under normal circumstances. In 2017, the economic impact was about $20.6 billion, then $21.6 billion in 2018, the Oshkosh Northwestern reported. In 2019, the economic impact was $22.2 billion, according to a WPR story. Then came the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, the economic impact dropped significantly to around $17.3 billion, then increased 21% to $20.9 billion in 2021, according to the department. Clearly, the tourism industry has been rebounding from COVID-19. The report says that ""key indicators point to the normalization of Wisconsin’s visitor activity in 2023."" But some of those indicators haven’t quite caught up to pre-pandemic levels. Those include employment directly supported by visitor activity, and local and state tax revenues. Still, previous reports show that 2023 was a record-setting year for tourism. That economic impact number appears to steadily rise and set new records each year, with the onset of COVID-19 as an exception. And it certainly won’t be a surprise if Wisconsin sets another record in 2024, when the effects of ""Top Chef"" and the RNC are accounted for. Our ruling Evers claimed Wisconsin had a ""record-breaking year"" for tourism in 2023. The $25 billion total economic impact did set a record in 2023. Setting a new record each year is common, though COVID-19 caused a dip that the state has largely recovered from. That impact isn’t felt equally in all communities in Wisconsin; some counties benefit far more from tourism than others. But all counties saw at least some increase in their totals from 2022 to 2023. And don’t be surprised if the state Department of Tourism announces another huge increase in 2024. We rate the claim True."

""In the year 2020 … the year I was elected president, only nine NATO allies were spending 2% of their defense — GDP on defense,"" Biden said. ""This year, 23 will spend at least 2%. And some will spend more than that."" A White House spokesperson cited NATO’s most recent data, which supports Biden’s claim. In 2024, 23 of 32 NATO members will spend at least 2% of their annual gross domestic product to build up their defenses, June 2024 NATO data shows. That same report said nine allies met the defense spending goal in 2020. Sign up for PolitiFact texts Experts said NATO’s data supports Biden’s statement but cautioned against attributing member nations’ increased defense spending to any one cause — or president. The NATO-provided spending figures for 2023 and 2024 were estimates, not finalized numbers, the organization said. We contacted NATO for clarification and received no response before publication. Typically, NATO data older than two years is final, but the previous and current year’s numbers are estimates, said Julie Garey, an associate teaching professor of political science at Northeastern University. Those figures are based on the information those countries provide — not all NATO members have the same fiscal year and not all of the countries have implemented their scheduled spending, experts said. NATO asks members for defense spending information once a year and then publishes updates accordingly, ""but not everything a state counts as ‘defense expenditures’ is included in NATO’s measure of spending,"" Garey said. Why NATO members have a 2% of GDP defense spending goal In 2014 — in response to instability in the Middle East and Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea — NATO leaders agreed to commit 2% of their national gross domestic product to defense spending. That agreement was a nonbinding goal that NATO countries planned to achieve ""within a decade."" The idea is that by spending at least 2% of a country’s GDP on defense, the allies will meet their own defense needs and be able to contribute to collective NATO action, Garey said. But there are no explicit consequences for a country that fails to meet NATO’s 2% of GDP defense spending goal. ""I can never emphasize enough that this is money being spent on each state’s defense — it’s not going directly to the alliance,"" she said. ""This is money that countries are spending on their own soldiers, equipment, and so forth, that they own and control and can use as they deem appropriate."" Countries that haven’t met the target might face pressure from allies to do more, but she said the 2% goal isn’t meant to be a reward or punishment system. Why are more countries meeting the goal in 2024? Experts said there are too many factors to attribute the rising number of countries meeting the 2% benchmark to one cause. The uptick in NATO countries working to increase their defense spending predates both Biden and former President Donald Trump. The key factor driving NATO members’ increased defense spending in 2023 and 2024 is ""a European sense of insecurity after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,"" said Alexandra Chinchilla, assistant professor of international affairs at the Bush School of Government & Public Service at Texas A&M University. Countries such as Latvia have required 2% military spending by law, said Anessa Kimball, a political science professor at Laval University and co-director of the Canadian Defence and Security Network. Other countries have been ""more creative in ‘what counts’ as defense spending,"" Kimball said. For example, Belgium counts railways as part of national defense. Greece counts spending on veterans’ pensions. Some NATO members are likely thinking ""about what a Europe post-NATO might look like"" and what each country might need to prepare if the U.S. left the alliance, Garey said. Trump, who is running for reelection in 2024, has repeatedly threatened to leave NATO. Our ruling Biden said that in 2020, ""only nine NATO allies were spending 2%"" of their GDP on defense, and in 2024 ""23 will spend at least 2%."" June 2024 NATO data supports his claim. NATO’s 2023 and 2024 figures are considered estimates, because not all NATO members have the same fiscal year and not all of the countries have implemented their scheduled spending. The numbers are typically finalized within two years. It's also worth clarifying that countries count ""defense spending"" differently, with some classifying money spent on things such as railways and veterans' pensions. Experts warned against attributing member nations’ increased defense spending to any one cause or president, though multiple experts linked Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine to the recent uptick in defense spending.

One Wisconsin lawmaker says funding for the state’s tourism department is up nearly 100 percent. ""The most recent State Budget increased funding for the Department of Tourism by 98 percent,"" state Sen. Rob Cowles, R-Green Bay, said July 12 during the Weekly GOP radio address posted on WisPolitics.com, as he hailed the importance of attracting tourists to the Badger State. Cowles’ address was made just a few days before the Republican National Convention, held July 15 to July 18, at Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee. Cowles referenced the RNC along with the upcoming NFL Draft, set for April 24–26, 2025, in Green Bay as important milestones for Wisconsin’s tourism industry. In his radio address, Cowles pointed out that tourists bring their wallets with them, and the money they spend patronizing local businesses and restaurants makes a difference in local communities and statewide. We were intrigued by Cowles' claim that funding had nearly doubled. Sign up for PolitiFact texts Is he right? Budget summary When asked for backup, the state senator’s staff pointed to data from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, a state government agency that provides fiscal and program information and analyses. A summary prepared by the bureau on the state Department of Tourism’s 2023-25 budget shows a table that puts the 2023-25 change at 97.8%. ""For simplicity in the radio address you are referencing, I rounded up to 98% to avoid the need to verbalize decimals in the radio address,"" Cowles wrote in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. Also in the email, Cowles explained that tourism spending ensures that more people learn about Wisconsin, and ""When visitors come to Wisconsin, we build a stronger tourism industry, which drives a stronger economy."" The state senator also touted tourism as a ""great return on investment. ""Visitors will spend their money here, leaving funds with small businesses throughout the state and generating additional revenues for local governments and the state government,"" he told PolitiFact in an email. Here is a breakdown of the fiscal bureau’s calculations: Tourism funding for fiscal year 2022-23 is $18,287,700. But the bureau uses a two-year budget system so the base year is doubled to $36,575,400 for the budget. Total funding for fiscal year 2023-25 is $72,343,900. Subtract $36,575,400 from that and you get $35,768,500 for one year and that equals an increase of 97.8% State’s role In a June 11, 2024 news release, Travel Wisconsin announced the 2023-25 biennial budget signed by Gov. Tony Evers invested approximately $35 million over the two-year period to raise Wisconsin’s profile across the country as a premier business, cultural, and recreational destination. ""This is the largest increase in marketing and advertising funds for the Wisconsin Department of Tourism in state history, and with this investment, the department will be able to run a competitive marketing campaign and keep pace with neighboring states,"" Travel Wisconsin said in the news release. Meanwhile, Evers’ office noted that when the governor introduced his 2023-25 budget, it proposed making more than $117 million in additional investments to bolster the state’s tourism industry, including efforts to expand existing programs such as the Tourism Capital Investment Grant Program, increase support for marketing and advertising initiatives, attract and recruit large-scale events and conventions to Wisconsin, and provide for the local arts with innovative programs and funds. ""In total, the final budget included less than half than what Gov. Evers originally requested to support the tourism industry in Wisconsin,"" Evers’ communications director Britt Cudaback said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. Our ruling Cowles said: ""The most recent State Budget increased funding for the Department of Tourism by 98 percent."" The state’s nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau confirmed the nearly 98% figure, so the math is correct. The governor’s office did object to Cowles’ radio address statements, saying that some of the funding requested in the governor’s budget aimed at tourism was removed or cut back by Republican legislators. Be that as it may, the nearly 98% figure Cowles touted in his radio address is right on the money. For a statement that is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing, our rating is True."
,HALF TRUE,Jacky Rosen,Sam Brown “said abortion should be banned without any exceptions for rape or incest.”,,2024-07-17,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/aug/19/jacky-rosen/jacky-rosen-oversimplifies-sam-browns-abortion-sta/,,"Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., is attacking her Republican opponent over his stance on abortion. Rosen, who was first elected in 2018, faces retired U.S. Army Capt. Sam Brown in a highly competitive swing state U.S. Senate race. This is Brown’s second campaign in Nevada. In 2014, he ran unsuccessfully for office in Texas, and in 2022, had a failed Republican primary bid for U.S. Senate in Nevada. In a 30-second ad appearing on TV and digital platforms, Rosen’s campaign argued Brown has shifted his public statements around abortion to suit his political aims. ""He's trying to change his story to get elected,"" the ad’s narrator said as an image of Brown speaking Feb. 21 on NBC News’ ""Meet the Press"" flashed on screen. The show’s chyron read, ""Nevada GOP Senate candidate says he wouldn’t support federal abortion ban."" The narrator continued: ""But for years, MAGA extremist Sam Brown has been pushing to ban abortion. He pushed to overturn Roe v. Wade. He said abortion should be banned without any exceptions for rape or incest."" Sign up for PolitiFact texts Brown has made several statements about abortion, not all of them consistent. Before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, Brown described himself as ""pro-life"" but did not specifically say whether or not he supported exceptions to laws restricting abortion access. In 2014, he said he supported a Texas law that banned abortion after 20 weeks without exceptions. In his 2024 run, however, he has been clear that he does not support a national abortion ban but that in states that ban abortion, he does support exceptions for rape and incest. Polling has generally shown Nevadans support abortion access. Nearly two-thirds of Nevada registered voters in a July 8, 2021, poll from OH Predictive Insight described themselves as ""pro-choice."" More than 60% of Nevada registered voters said in an April 2023 poll commissioned by the Nevada Independent they supported amending the state constitution to guarantee a woman's right to obtain an abortion, a measure that will also appear on November’s ballot. Rosen’s claims Rosen’s ad pointed to a June 2023 HuffPost article that linked to Brown’s response to a 2022 questionnaire from the Christian fundamentalist American Families Association. Asked, ""Under what circumstances should abortion be allowed?"" Brown’s response read, ""Risk of life to the mother."" Brown’s campaign in 2023 sought to distance itself from the 2022 response, however, saying a campaign staffer filled it out without Brown’s authorization. Rosen’s ad also included a snippet of Brown speaking at a 2014 candidate forum held by the Far North Dallas Tea Party. In it, Brown said he supported a 2013 Texas law banning abortion after 20 weeks. Statehouse Republicans rejected a Democratic-backed amendment to that law that would have included exceptions for rape or incest. ""On issues of life, that is nonnegotiable for me,"" Brown said in the video clip. Asked for evidence behind Rosen’s claim, Rosen campaign spokesperson Johanna Warshaw pointed PolitiFact to a May 11, 2022, Reno Gazette-Journal article in which Brown was asked about his abortion views. ""In light of a recently leaked Supreme Court draft opinion that would reverse Roe v. Wade, would you stand behind any federal restrictions on abortion, and what exceptions, if any, do you support?"" the newspaper asked. Brown’s response did not address exceptions. It read: ""I'm pro life, and I always will stand on the side of protecting life. I gained a true appreciation for the value of life when I was in Afghanistan and nearly lost my own to a Taliban bomb. As a senator, I'll continue to protect life by voting against any federal funding of abortion and by voting to confirm justices who protect life."" A timeline of Brown’s stance We independently reviewed Brown’s abortion statements and also found: During his 2014 campaign for Texas House of Representatives, Brown said the following on his campaign website: ""Abortion is not an issue of choice. It is an issue of life and I am proudly pro-life. We need to do everything possible to support and encourage young mothers who are considering abortion to pursue adoption or to recognize the value of life and raise the child they have been blessed with."" The website included no statements about exceptions to anti-abortion laws. Starting in November 2022, Brown chaired the Nevada Faith and Freedom Coalition, a nonprofit faith-based advocacy group. Brown has described the Nevada chapter as a ""spinoff""of the national group, but a separate organization. Ralph Reed, the national Faith and Freedom Coalition’s founder, has said his group will support any legislation that limits abortion, including a total ban. An archived version of the Nevada Faith and Freedom Coalition’s issues page does not mention abortion. On July 12, 2023, the day after he launched his Senate campaign, a KSNV-TV reporter asked Brown about his abortion stance. Brown said, ""You know, I would love to see fewer abortions. I am pro-life. And you know, with exceptions for those tragic cases in which there is rape, incest, or a threat to the life of the mother, but I think we can do better in helping to sort of create a pathway for adoption."" A Dec. 5, 2023, Nevada Independent article reported that Brown’s campaign said it ""disavows"" and had ""no involvement"" with the 2022 questionnaire in which Brown said he supports abortion law exceptions when the mother’s life is at risk. The campaign attributed the answer to a junior staff member who it said had not been authorized to respond. In a Feb. 12, NBC News interview, Brown’s wife, Amy Brown, described that days before she met her husband-to-be, she had an abortion because of an ""immense amount of pressure that I had to do it."" Sam Brown said in the interview that he supported exceptions to abortion bans for rape, incest and when the mother’s life is threatened. In a June 30, op-ed for the Las Vegas Sun, Brown wrote: ""Yes, Amy and I are pro-life. We believe in exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. It is our hope that women choose life, and more families experience the joys of parenthood. Brown’s response Brown campaign spokesperson Kristy Wilkinson on Aug. 10 reiterated to PolitiFact that the American Families Association voter guide response didn’t reflect Brown’s stance. ""He never even saw it,"" Wilkinson said. ""As he has stated many, many times on the record, he believes in exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother."" Wilkinson told PolitiFact that Brown’s support for the 2013 Texas law was consistent with his current belief that decisions on abortion restrictions should be left to the states. She said he also wanted exceptions for rape and incest included in the law. Wilkinson did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for examples of his 2013 advocacy for those exceptions, and we found no evidence of Brown’s advocacy for exceptions. Our ruling A Rosen campaign ad said Brown ""said abortion should be banned without exceptions for rape or incest."" Brown supported Texas' 20-week abortion ban, which had no exceptions for rape or incest. Brown also said states should have final say on abortion access, which leaves open the possibility that states pass abortion bans without exceptions for rape or incest. In a 2022 candidate survey, Brown listed ""risk of life to the mother"" as the only exception to an abortion ban he would support. Brown has since disavowed that survey, saying he was not the one who filled it out. In public comments since the Supreme Court ruled against federally protected abortion access, and on the campaign trail in 2024, Brown has said he supports exceptions, including for rape and incest. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True. PolitiFact Researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report.

,MOSTLY TRUE,Donald Trump Jr.,"After being shot at a Milwaukee rally in 1912, former President Teddy Roosevelt “finished his speech and he kept fighting.”",,2024-07-17,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/jul/18/donald-trump-jr/trump-jr-mostly-right-on-story-about-teddy-rooseve/,,"When former President Donald Trump arrived in Milwaukee for the Republican National Convention, comparisons to the plight of another storied former president were plentiful. Trump, the GOP nominee to take on President Joe Biden this fall, flew to Wisconsin after a rally in Pennsylvania during which he was shot in the ear with a bullet that was meant to take his life. More than a century ago, former Republican President Teddy Roosevelt was visiting Milwaukee for a rally when he was shot and injured in an assassination attempt. That attempted assassination isn’t very well known, but it’s been a talking point at the convention this week as conservatives seek to tie Trump to Roosevelt, who carefully cultivated a manly image. Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., referred to it during his Wednesday night speech at the convention, broadcast to millions of viewers across the country. Sign up for PolitiFact texts ""At a political rally less than 1 mile from where we stand tonight, Teddy Roosevelt was struck by a would-be assassin’s bullet,"" Trump Jr. said. ""But he didn’t quit, either. He finished his speech and kept fighting."" Trump Jr. has the general idea right, but is off on a few details — which make the story of what happened to Roosevelt all the more interesting. Roosevelt shot before speech; copy of remarks, glasses case slowed the bullet Roosevelt was touring the Midwest when he visited Milwaukee in 1912, campaigning for a third term as president because he was unhappy with the work of then-President William Howard Taft, according to a Library of Congress article on the incident. He arrived in the city Oct. 14, 1912. He dined at the Gilpatrick Hotel — now the site of the Hyatt Regency Milwaukee — then set out to head to the Milwaukee Auditorium, now Miller High Life Theatre, to give his speech. Outside the hotel, he was shot by a man named John Schrank from New York City, who had followed Roosevelt through several states to attempt to kill him. Roosevelt fell back and the bullet pierced his chest, according to the Library of Congress article — but not before it was slowed by a metal eyeglasses case and a 50-page copy of his speech folded in half. After Schrank was taken into custody, Roosevelt was driven to the auditorium — about a block away — and delivered an hour-plus speech to the crowd with the bullet still inside him, using his bloodied shirt as a symbol of his resilience. He was then rushed to the hospital. So, although Trump was actively delivering his speech at a rally when he was shot, Roosevelt wasn’t in the exact same situation, as Trump Jr. claimed. He was shot before his speech and decided to give it anyway. (Granted, the security procedures for protecting a former president after an assassination attempt were likely much different in 1912 than they are today.) The attempt on Roosevelt’s life was one event that shaped his image as a ""self-made cowboy soldier,"" History.com describes, who ""embodied a new ideal of manliness."" Republicans have been pitching themselves for years as ""the party of manliness, the alphas, of the tough ones,"" American University assistant professor of public communications Kurt Braddock told The Washington Post. Drawing parallels between Trump and Roosevelt, Braddock said, feeds that idea. Our ruling Trump Jr., in connecting the attempted assassination of his father to the one of Roosevelt in Milwaukee in 1912, said Roosevelt was struck at a political rally, ""finished his speech and kept fighting."" It wasn’t midrally, as happened to Trump, but Roosevelt certainly did press on, cementing a forceful image of himself that Trump supporters seek to have the public remember. Our definition of Mostly True is a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. That fits here."
,MOSTLY TRUE,Kamala Harris,Donald Trump “took away protections against discrimination for LGBTQ patients under the Affordable Care Act.”,,2024-07-20,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/sep/09/kamala-harris/mostly-true-trump-admin-reversed-lgbtq-protections/,,"With weeks to go until Americans start casting 2024 presidential election ballots, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris wants voters to be clear about where she and former President Donald Trump diverge on LGBTQ+ rights. ""If Donald Trump wins in November, he will once again implement policies that target the LGBTQ community,"" Harris said in a video she shared Aug. 11 on X. ""Just look at what he did his first term in office. He took away protections against discrimination for LGBTQ patients under the Affordable Care Act."" Harris made the comments during a July 20 fundraiser in Provincetown, Massachusetts, a day before President Joe Biden withdrew from the presidential race and endorsed her for president. Harris’ claim is largely accurate. Under the Trump administration, the Department of Health and Human Services finalized a rule that removed several LGBTQ+ discrimination protections that the Obama administration had instituted. When we contacted the Harris campaign for evidence, a spokesperson pointed us to this rule change. A Trump campaign spokesperson said Harris’ claim was a ""lie"" but provided no evidence. The rule, which outlined how the administration would interpret Section 1557, the Affordable Care Act’s anti-discrimination clause, removed measures prohibiting gender identity discrimination and eliminated broader protections for transgender people seeking health care coverage. Sign up for PolitiFact texts But legal challenges complicate the story. Courts paused enforcement of both the Obama and Trump rules soon after they were finalized, so how Trump’s rollback affected LGBTQ+ patients who faced discrimination is uncertain. Trump administration removed several Obama-era LGBTQ+ discrimination protections Section 1557 of the 2010 Affordable Care Act prohibits discrimination based on race, color, national origin, disability, age and sex in federally funded health programs and activities. Obama’s Department of Health and Human Services didn’t finalize its regulations for how to apply this portion of the ACA until May 2016, at the end of Obama’s second term and months before the presidential election. The final guidance included several provisions that aimed to protect transgender patients from discrimination in health care and insurance coverage. Trump’s Department of Health and Human Services in 2020 finalized its own regulations, removing several of the Obama administration-issued protections. KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research center broke down some of the most most substantive changes: Whereas the Obama-era regulations’ definition of ""sex discrimination"" included discrimination based on gender identity and sex stereotyping, Trump-era regulations removed the entire sex discrimination definition. The Trump change noted that ""the final rule reverts to, and relies upon, the plain meaning of the term (sex)]"" which it described as the ""biological binary of male and female that human beings share with other mammals."" Obama-era regulations required that ACA-covered entities ""provide individuals equal access to its health programs or activities without discrimination on the basis of sex"" and ""treat individuals consistent with their gender identity."" Trump-era regulations removed both these provisions. Obama-era regulations prohibited health insurers from categorially excluding coverage of gender-affirming care. They also included more general prohibitions on discrimination in insurance coverage based on sex or gender identity. Trump-era regulations removed these provisions. Beyond Section 1557, the Trump-era rule removed sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination protections from other Affordable Care Act provisions related to state Medicaid programs and the marketplaces on which people can buy insurance through the ACA. The Biden administration in April 2024 reinstated much of what the Obama administration instituted in 2016 and added protections for sexual orientation. The legal wrestling over Section 1557 regulations Although regulations the Trump administration issued undid Obama-era LGBTQ+ discrimination protections in the ACA, a tangled legal landscape means the ability to enforce these anti-discrimination provisions isn’t clear. After seeking public comment about health care discrimination in 2013, and proposing a rule in 2015, Obama-era regulations, including LGBTQ+ protections, took effect in July 2016. But a lawsuit brought by a group of religiously affiliated health care providers and states meant that, by December 2016, key LGBTQ+ protections were put on hold as the court weighed the matter. A Texas federal judge issued a preliminary injunction in Franciscan Alliance v. Burwell, pausing the enforcement of the regulations’ sections on ""gender identity"" and ""termination of pregnancy."" The injunction didn’t affect the provision on sex stereotyping. When the Obama administration included sex stereotyping in the 2016 rule, it said the provision could offer protections against sexual orientation discrimination. But, because of the injunction, it’s unclear how well the Obama-era rule could protect against LGBTQ+ discrimination. Once Trump took office, his administration did not challenge the Franciscan Alliance injunction in court. The Trump administration finalized its own rule rolling back LGBTQ+ protections in 2020, citing the 2019 Franciscan Alliance case ruling as affirmation for the move. But the Trump administration’s rule also drew legal challenges. Days before the Trump administration announced its new regulations, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling. Weighing cases in which employees said they were fired for being gay or transgender, the Supreme Court ruled in Bostock v. Clayton County that firing people for their sexual orientation or gender identity amounts to ""sex discrimination,"" which is prohibited under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Despite the ruling, the Trump administration issued its final regulations four days later removing LGBTQ+ protections and adopting a narrower understanding of ""sex discrimination."" Two transgender patients in New York sued to stop the new Trump-era rule. As a result, a federal judge issued a nationwide injunction a day before the rule was to take effect. Once Biden took office, the Department of Health and Human Services said it would use a broader, LGBTQ+ inclusive interpretation of sex discrimination, given the Bostock ruling. This position was codified in a new rule, which was challenged in court and paused. Our ruling Harris said that Trump, ""took away protections against discrimination for LGBTQ patients under the Affordable Care Act."" The Trump administration rolled back numerous Obama-era protections against LGBTQ+ discrimination in health care and insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act. But because legal challenges hampered enforcement of both the Obama- and Trump-era rules, it’s hard to say how the Trump administration’s action affected LGBTQ+ patients. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True."
,MOSTLY TRUE,Pete Buttigieg,"“Even before the pandemic, America went into a manufacturing recession.”",,2024-07-28,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/jul/31/pete-buttigieg/was-us-manufacturing-in-recession-before-the-pande/,,"Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, a leading surrogate for the Biden-Harris administration, attracted notice when he sat for an interview with Fox News, which typically draws audiences that support former President Donald Trump. In his July 28 interview on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Buttigieg, who’s been floated as a possible vice presidential pick for Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, took on Trump’s record in office. He criticized Trump's broken promises on economic growth and on delivering an infrastructure bill. An example, Buttigieg said, was that ""before the pandemic, America went into a manufacturing recession, which really hurt places like where I come from in the industrial Midwest. He broke his promise for that kind of economic growth."" Several economists agreed that there’s evidence to support what Buttigieg said. ""There’s some truth to that,"" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the center-right American Action Forum. The Transportation Department did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Sign up for PolitiFact texts Data on the manufacturing sector There’s a clear definition of a ""recession"" for the entire economy: A committee of economists with the nonprofit National Bureau of Economic Research decides, retroactively, when the U.S. economy entered and exited a recession, using a range of economic metrics. By contrast, defining a ""recession"" for one sector, such as manufacturing, is murkier. Because there’s no official arbiter, someone can use one of several metrics, particularly employment level and output in goods. Looking at employment levels within manufacturing, the number of workers rose modestly, by about 3.3% during Trump’s presidency before the pandemic. However, a closer look shows that in 2019, manufacturing employment flatlined, then fell slightly by the pandemic’s eve in March 2020. The second useful metric is the production of manufactured goods — and the recessionary trend line is even clearer here. For that measure, we consulted federal Bureau of Labor Statistics data for inflation-adjusted output for all manufacturing workers. This statistic, calculated quarterly, compares how much higher or lower output was in a given quarter compared with the same quarter in the previous year. By this metric, manufacturing output reached an 11-year peak in 2018’s third quarter, which came during Trump’s presidency. There was growth in the next quarter, but it slowed. Then, in 2019’s first quarter, the year-over-year change turned negative, partly because of a trade war with China, and it remained negative in each of the four succeeding quarters. In other words, manufacturing output was declining for more than a year — then the pandemic hit. A similar statistic — the industrial production index, calculated by the Federal Reserve — mirrored this pattern. This monthly statistic fell by about 2.4% from August 2018 to February 2020. Collectively, these metrics show that ""there was weakening in terms of industrial output,"" said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. The decline was ""chump change compared with the drop that occurred in the COVID-19 recession,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C., think tank. Still, these metrics show that ""real output was falling even before COVID-19 infections began to soar."" Burtless added that this was known at the time. A Washington Post news report in January 2020 was headlined, ""U.S. manufacturing was in a mild recession during 2019, a sore spot for the economy."" The article cited Federal Reserve data showing U.S. factory production shrinking by 1.3% during 2019, ""the worst year for manufacturing since 2015, as the trade war, lackluster global growth and problems at airplane maker Boeing hurt America’s industrial economy."" Other news outlets, including CNN and the Los Angeles Times,.also described a recession in manufacturing around the same time, Our ruling Buttigieg said, ""Even before the pandemic, America went into a manufacturing recession."" There is no official definition for when an industrial sector enters recession, but by two common metrics — employment and output — U.S. manufacturing was tipping negative starting in early 2019, Trump’s third year in office. Although manufacturing employment rose robustly for the first two years of Trump’s term, this job growth stalled in his third year and fell slightly before the pandemic hit during his fourth year. Manufacturing output, by two separate metrics, fell modestly but consistently following its 2018 peak. The data doesn’t point to a raging recession in manufacturing, but it does provide strong evidence of a downturn. We rate Buttigieg’s statement Mostly True."
,FALSE,JD Vance,“[Kamala Harris] wants to take away your gas stoves.”,,2024-08-03,,Washington Post,,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/13/trio-silly-false-claims-that-jd-vance-makes-about-kamala-harris/,,"This is false. Harris has never advocated taking away gas stoves and in fact has tweeted photos of herself cooking with a gas stove. This line appears based on a manufactured controversy from last January, when a member of the Consumer Product Safety Commission said that gas stoves were a “hidden hazard” because of their pollutants. “Any option is on the table,” the member, Richard Trumka Jr., said in an interview with Bloomberg News that was published on Jan. 9, 2023. “Products that can’t be made safe can be banned.” The CPSC is an independent agency with five commissioners, usually with three representing the party of the sitting president. Trumka has a Democratic seat and was appointed by President Joe Biden. When a firestorm erupted, Trumka tweeted the same day: “To be clear, CPSC isn’t coming for anyone’s gas stoves. Regulations apply to new products.” On Jan. 11, 2023, CPSC chair Alexander Hoehn-Saric issued a statement: “To be clear, I am not looking to ban gas stoves and the CPSC has no proceeding to do so. CPSC is researching gas emissions in stoves and exploring new ways to address health risks. CPSC also is actively engaged in strengthening voluntary safety standards for gas stoves.” In other words, the issue was quickly settled. The Biden administration never had a policy on gas stoves. And Harris never said a word about it. In fact, as we noted, she uses a gas stove — presumably with proper ventilation."
,FALSE,JD Vance,“[Kamala Harris] even wants to take away your ability to eat red meat. That’s how out there she is. That’s real. The fake news will fact-check it. They will fact-check it true. She actually said that.”,,2024-08-03,,Washington Post,,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/13/trio-silly-false-claims-that-jd-vance-makes-about-kamala-harris/,,"During a 2019 climate-change forum on CNN, one participant noted that climate change had been linked to consumption of red meat and overproduction of crops. She asked Harris whether she supported changing dietary guidelines as a way to encourage people to reduce their consumption of meat. Harris gave a long answer but, in essence, she said she would support a change in the guidelines, as there had to be incentives to encourage less consumption of meat — even though she loved a cheeseburger from time to time. “As a nation we actually have to have a real priority at the highest level of government around what we eat and in terms of health eating because we have a problem in America. … The balance that we have to strike here, frankly, is about what government can and should do around creating incentives and then banning certain behaviors,” Harris said. “I mean just to be very honest with you; I love cheeseburgers from time to time. I just do. … But there has to be also what we do in terms of creating incentives that we will eat in a healthy way, that we will encourage moderation, and that we will be educated about the effects of our eating habits on our environment, and we have to do a much better job of that. And the government has to do a much better job of that.” Erin Burnett, the moderator, followed up to see if Harris would support updating the “food pyramid.” (This was a bit out of date. In 2011 the Agriculture Department replaced the food pyramid with an image called “MyPlate,” which on the USDA website can be customized to dietary needs, preferences, cultural traditions and other factors.) Harris said “yes” and added: “It is about consumer awareness, also. And again, maybe this comes from my years of being — doing the work I did as attorney general, which is, I strongly believe that the American consumer is still left without the information that you need and deserve to have about what it is that you are putting in your body or surrounding yourself with. And the health implications of those things.” In sum, Harris never said she would ban red meat or hinder the ability of people to eat meat. She even said she loved cheeseburgers. When she mentions “banning certain behaviors,” that is in the context of the government finding the right balance to motivate people to eat properly. For that reason, she supported a change in dietary guidelines. But there is no requirement for Americans to follow dietary guidelines — so people can eat as much red meat as they want."
,MOSTLY TRUE,Lindsey Graham,Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz signed “legislation giving free college … to illegal immigrants.”,,2024-08-06,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/aug/09/lindsey-graham/gov-tim-walz-signed-law-giving-some-minnesota-stud/,,"Republican critics of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the running mate of Democratic presidential nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris, have focused on his immigration policies. ""Not only did Governor Tim Walz sign legislation giving free college and free health care to illegal immigrants, but he sat on the sidelines and watched Minneapolis burn for four days straight,"" U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., wrote Aug. 6 on X. We are examining Walz’s record on health care for people in the country illegally and his response to riots after George Floyd’s May 2020 death in separate fact-checks. Here, we wanted to check whether Walz offered ""free college … to illegal immigrants. The Republican National Committee’s X account, conservative pundit Charlie Kirk and former National Intelligence Acting Director Richard Grenell made similar claims about tuition. The short story: Walz signed a scholarship program into law that covers tuition at Minnesota public colleges and universities for students who meet family income restrictions. Students in the country illegally qualify for the aid under certain conditions. Sign up for PolitiFact texts Program covers public college tuition for need-based eligible students In May 2023, Walz signed the North Star Promise Scholarship into law. The program, part of a larger higher education bill, awards tuition scholarships to eligible students whose families earn less than $80,000. Scholarship amounts will vary; the state would pay what isn’t covered by a student’s grants, financial aid and scholarships. Students eligible for the Minnesota Dream Act can apply for the scholarship. That 2013 law, which came during Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton’s administration, makes students who attended a Minnesota high school for at least three years and graduated or received a GED certificate in Minnesota eligible for certain benefits, even if they are in the country illegally. Benefits include access to in-state tuition, state financial aid and private aid to attend Minnesota public colleges and universities. The Walz-backed scholarship program begins in the 2024-25 school year, ""so as of now, no Minnesotan has received funding through the program yet,"" said Keith Hovis, communications director for Minnesota’s Office of Higher Education. To keep the scholarship, students must satisfy their college or university’s GPA standards. In the 2021-22 school year, 314 Minnesotan students received financial aid through the Minnesota Dream Act. However, not everyone who is eligible for financial aid qualifies for the scholarship program, Hovis said. In May, the Minnesota Legislature renewed the scholarship program. The original bill earmarked $117 million for the program. The second bill transferred $5 million of that money to a different college tuition grant program for certain students who went through foster care. Eligible students who are in the U.S. illegally also qualify for that grant. A Republican senator introduced an amendment to restrict the scholarship program to only students legally residing in Minnesota. But the amendment failed in a 34-33 party-line vote with Democrats in the majority. The Migration Policy Institute, a think tank, estimates that 81,000 people in the U.S. illegally live in Minnesota. The Institute of Taxation and Economic Policy, a left-leaning think tank, reported that immigrants in Minnesota illegally contributed around $222 million in state tax revenue in 2022. Our ruling Graham said Walz signed ""legislation giving free college … to illegal immigrants."" Graham’s statement is onto something, but is a touch too broad. Walz signed two higher education bills in 2023 and 2024 that covered tuition costs at Minnesota’s public colleges and universities for students whose families earn less than $80,000 annually. Students who are illegally in the U.S. can apply for this tuition aid if they have attended a Minnesota school for at least three years, graduated or received a GED certificate in Minnesota and satisfied other requirements for income and maintaining their school’s GPA standards.

During the early years of the war, Walz, who served 24 years in the Army National Guard, eyed retirement and a political career. He submitted retirement paperwork five to seven months before retiring in May 2005 to run for Congress. As he awaited his retirement paperwork’s processing, Walz filed paperwork to run for Congress in February 2005, a month before his battalion received a March notification for a potential deployment to Iraq within two years. Walz’s battalion was officially ordered to deploy to Iraq in July 2005, two months after Walz retired. But was what Vance said about Walz not carrying weapons in combat accurate? Walz first enlisted in the Nebraska National Guard in 1981 days after he turned 17. He transferred to the Minnesota National Guard in 1996, where he served in the 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery until he retired in May 2005. The Associated Press reported that Walz was a field artillery cannoneer as a member of the Texas Army National Guard in 1985 when he attended the University of Houston, and that he also served as an instructor with the Arkansas Army National Guard. Walz spent months on active duty deployed overseas, but didn’t serve in Iraq or Afghanistan. He and his battalion deployed to Italy in August 2003 to support U.S. operations in Afghanistan under Operation Enduring Freedom. He returned to Minnesota in April 2004, a Minnesota National Guard spokesperson told PolitiFact. In an email, Lauren Hitt, a Harris-Walz campaign spokesperson, told PolitiFact that Walz thanked Vance for his service and ""misspoke"" in the 2018 video. ""In making the case for why weapons of war should never be on our streets or in our classrooms, the Governor misspoke,"" Hitt said. ""He did handle weapons of war and believes strongly that only military members trained to carry those deadly weapons should have access to them, unlike Donald Trump and JD Vance who prioritize the gun lobby over our children."" Luke Schroeder, a Trump-Vance campaign spokesperson, said Walz ""absolutely said this, that’s not in dispute,"" pointing to the video the Harris campaign shared on X. Schroeder also pointed to several news articles about Walz’s military service that showed he didn’t see combat duty. Minnesota Public Radio reported in 2018 that in his military career, Walz responded to weather disasters such as floods and tornadoes, and spent months deployed overseas. He specialized in heavy artillery and won ribbons for his proficiency in sharpshooting and hand grenades, the outlet wrote, citing military records. He never saw combat, Minnesota Public Radio reported. ""I know that there are certainly folks that did far more than I did. I know that,"" Walz told the news outlet. ""I willingly say that I got far more out of the military than they got out of me, from the GI Bill to leadership opportunities to everything else."" Vance served as a combat correspondent, working in public affairs for the U.S. Marine Corps from 2003 to 2007 and deployed to Iraq for six months in 2005.

The proposal included a plan that said all federal legislation sunsets in five years. ""If a law is worth keeping, Congress can pass it again,"" Scott wrote in the plan. Democrats instantly attacked Scott and Republicans for pushing to end Social Security and Medicare. Although Scott did not specifically mention Social Security or Medicare in the plan, both are pieces of federal legislation that would theoretically sunset under his language. We have fact-checked multiple claims from Democrats about Scott’s plan and typically found them misleading. That includes a March 22, 2022, claim by Democrats we rated Mostly False for describing the plan as the Senate Republicans’ plan rather than Scott’s alone. Scott eventually revised the plan in February 2023 to include a note saying his call to sunset federal legislation was never intended to apply to Social Security or Medicare. Brown and Scott’s plan The Rosen ad cites an Aug. 2, 2024, article from American Journal News saying Brown praised Scott for creating the original plan. The American Journal News is a liberal media outlet that receives funding from the American Bridge 21st Century Foundation, a political action committee founded by David Brock, a political consultant closely aligned with 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. The foundation specializes in opposition research against Republicans. The article cites Brown’s comments during his 2022 Senate run, captured in a recording, to the Spring Mountain Republican Women in Las Vegas two days after Scott released his plan. Responding to a question about McConnell’s leadership and which senators he admired most, Brown mentioned Scott for his work on the plan. ""I think I appreciate that he is trying to look forward, he is trying to cast a positive vision,"" Brown said. ""One of the things, I think, that some of the Republican Party leaders have failed at is we have become labeled — and sometimes we do this to ourselves — is we become the party of 'No. Oh, no, we're not going to do that.’ We're the party of just rejecting policy instead of the party of projecting ideas. What Rick Scott has done, attempting to create a roadmap for a better America, is something that I admire as well."" Brown never mentions specifics or outright endorses Scott’s plan in the recording. Rosen spokeswoman Johanna Warshaw said there had already been ample news coverage of the potential impacts of Scott’s plan to Social Security and Medicare when Brown made his comments. Other evidence of supporting cuts Warshaw also pointed to Brown’s support for broader federal cuts, such as those called for in a balanced budget amendment, as evidence that he supports cutting Social Security and Medicare. In February, Brown backed a 2018 plan from Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., that called for a 1% cut to federal spending across the board to balance the budget, according to a July 2024 article from the Nevada Current, a nonprofit news site. Although Paul described the mix of cuts and spending freezes as minimal — around $13 billion — the Washington Post Fact Checker found that description misleading, noting it did not account for increased participation in Social Security and Medicare as baby boomers retire. The Fact Checker report said that when accounting for factors such as increased population and inflation, Paul’s proposed cuts totaled trillions of dollars. Brown told the Current he supported a balanced budget amendment and thought Paul’s proposal was ""a very reasonable place to start."" Then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., promised a vote on a bill in 2023 balancing the budget within 10 years. McCarthy said he did not want cuts to defense, Social Security and Medicare, but an analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found excluding those programs for cuts would mean reducing the rest of the budget by 85%. Including them would still mean cutting Social Security and Medicare by 25% to reach a balanced budget. Despite economists’ questions on how Congress could feasibly balance the budget without cutting Social Security or Medicare, Brown told the Current he did not support cuts to Social Security or Medicare. Brown said the same in an Aug. 26, 2024, YouTube video released after the Rosen ad began airing, adding he thought Social Security income should not be taxed. Our ruling Rosen said, ""Sam Brown publicly supported forcing massive cuts to Social Security and Medicare and was caught on tape saying he admires the plan to phase out Social Security and Medicare in five years."" Brown never said he supported Scott’s plan, only that he admired Scott’s trying to articulate a vision for the Republican Party. Brown has also said he specifically does not want to cut Social Security or Medicare, but there is some truth to Rosen’s claim that Brown supported across-the-board cuts to federal agencies through a balanced budget amendment. Balancing the federal budget is not as simple as it sounds and the balanced budget plan Brown supported would almost guarantee cuts to Social Security and Medicare. We rate the claim Mostly False."
,MOSTLY FALSE,Sam Brown,"Nevada Sen. Jacky Rosen said the Biden administration did a ""tremendous job"" on the U.S. military’s Afghanistan withdrawal.",,2024-08-15,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/sep/26/sam-brown/did-nevada-sen-jacky-rosen-say-joe-biden-did-a-tre/,,"Three years after the Taliban retook Kabul, marking a victory for the group in the Afghanistan War, Republican Senate candidate Sam Brown said Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., characterized the American withdrawal as a ""tremendous job."" ""It’s been three years since the fall of Kabul,"" Brown said in an Aug. 15 X post. ""@RosenForNevada might be the only person around who said Biden-Harris did a ‘tremendous job’ on the withdrawal. 13 Americans were killed and hundreds were left behind. That is called a tremendous failure, Jacky."" Brown, a former U.S. Army captain seeking to unseat the first-term senator, has campaigned frequently on his background as an Afghanistan War veteran. The withdrawal of American forces from Afghanistan in August 2021 also marked a significant turning point for Democrats, including Democratic President Joe Biden, whose approval rating plummeted in the immediate aftermath and never fully recovered. We asked Brown for evidence Rosen said Biden did a ""tremendous job"" on the withdrawal. Campaign spokesperson Kristy Wilkinson pointed us to an Oct. 2, 2021, Rosen appearance on KLAS-TV’s ""Politics Now."" But Brown twists what Rosen meant when she said the State Department did a ""tremendous job"" getting Americans out of Afghanistan. He also omits what Rosen said during and after the evacuation. Sign up for PolitiFact texts The withdrawal timeline The United States under Republican then-President Donald Trump and the Taliban signed a peace agreement Feb. 29, 2020, in Doha, Qatar — commonly known as the Doha accords or Doha agreement — which ended fighting between the Taliban and the U.S. and set a scaled deadline for NATO troop withdrawal. All NATO forces were to be out of the country by May 1, 2021. Biden said April 2021 that the remaining 2,500 U.S. service members would not be out of the country by that deadline, so he set a date of Sept. 11, 2021. He revised that date in July, setting Aug. 31, 2021 as a final withdrawal deadline. The Taliban advanced quickly over summer 2021, retaking the capital of Kabul on Aug. 15, 2021. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani’s military offered little resistance, with Ghani fleeing the country the same day. Thousands rushed Kabul’s international airport the next day looking for a safe exit from the country. The Afghan government’s rapid breakdown gave ISIS an opening to launch a suicide bomb attack at Kabul’s airport Aug. 26, 2021, that killed 13 American service members and 170 Afghan civilians. The U.S. completed its military withdrawal Aug. 30, 2021. Rosen’s reaction Rosen campaign spokesperson Johanna Warshaw said Rosen’s ""tremendous job"" comment referred to officials working quickly to abide by the Aug. 31, 2021, deadline to get Americans out of the country quickly as the Taliban took over. It is also far from Rosen’s only comment on the withdrawal. Here’s how her response unfolded: Rosen, in an Aug. 16, 2021, statement, questioned the Biden administration’s lack of foresight into the Afghan government’s deterioration. ""When we are sure Americans and our Afghan partners are safe, Congress and the administration must work together to assess why we did not anticipate that the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces would prove so ineffective in holding off the Taliban and why our plans to safely evacuate embassy personnel, Afghan translators and others did not account for the rapid Taliban takeover of Kabul,"" Rosen said. ""For now, though, we must focus on the mission at hand and limit further loss of life."" Rosen, during a Sept. 28, 2021, Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, told Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and then-Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley she was frustrated with the withdrawal. ""You know, I just want to speak about how, as Americans, we are really frustrated, all of us, about the way we withdrew from Afghanistan, but we nonetheless understand the difficult position that you and our men and women in uniform on the ground were—the position you were in last month,"" Rosen said. ""So, what the American people fail to understand, however – and what I too have difficulty accepting – is the idea that the circumstances we found ourselves in were inevitable."" Rosen, who is on the Senate Armed Services Committee, sat for the KLAS-TV interview a few days after the hearing. She said the following in response to a reporter’s question about Austin’s and Milley’s answers about the failures during the evacuation (we bolded the relevant portion): ""Let’s be clear that the Doha agreement was made in the spring of 2020 by President Trump. And so, I believe, as was testified to, alluded to today by the generals and of course the defense secretary, that American lives, American men and women in uniform and others, may have been in harm’s way had we extended past the Aug. 31, (2021) deadline. ""Therefore, we quickly had to marshal our resources to do that massive evacuation. Like I said, over 124,000 individuals. That is still ongoing for anyone who wants to be evacuated to safety. Our office, our office is — all of the Senate offices, I would imagine, across the country — working with Department of State and others, working to ensure that safe passage for anyone remains. ""And so, I think that it had to happen quickly. They did a tremendous job doing that. There are a lot of lessons to be learned and a lot of takeaways. This is just the first step in the hearing to get to the bottom of that."" Rosen rebuffed the Biden administration’s withdrawal March 28, 2023, breaking with her party to support an amendment from Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., to establish a joint committee investigating the Afghanistan withdrawal. This amendment, which was attached to a bill repealing authorization for the presidential use of military force against Iraq, failed by a 33-62 vote. Rosen was the lone Democratic vote in favor. Our ruling Brown said Rosen said the Biden administration did a ""tremendous job"" on the Afghanistan withdrawal. Rosen did make comments commending the effort to pull U.S. personnel from Afghanistan by the intended deadline amid a rapidly deteriorating political and military situation. However, she was not complimenting the Biden administration’s overall plan for withdrawal. Her post-withdrawal actions ranged from skeptical to critical. She was the only Democrat to vote with Republicans to form a committee investigating the Biden administration’s withdrawal strategy. We rate the claim Mostly False."

Su was in Milwaukee in August to recognize the Biden administration’s designating the city a ""workforce hub"" allowing officials to work with federal agencies to remove lead pipes. While here, Su also discussed the need to boost training opportunities for the building trades. During a press conference, she said, ""Four hundred thousand workers are now in a union that were not in a union when (Biden) became president."" That sounds like a lot of new union members, but is that accurate? Really? 400,000 new union workers? After the visit, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel contacted Su’s office to get more evidence for the claim and it responded with information from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Sign up for PolitiFact texts Based on the bureau’s information, the number of workers (age 16 and older) who are union members went from 14,012,000 in 2021, when Biden took office, to 14,424,000 in 2023. This year’s data has not been released, but comparing those numbers, it shows union membership increased by about 412,000. So the figure Su cited is correct. But wait, there’s more (context) This is a claim in which context is important. Su and the Biden administration are trying to show that workers and unions are benefiting — and growing — because of current policies. But the increase of union workers follows more of an industry recovery pattern from the 2020 coronavirus pandemic which impacted workforces across all sectors. Industries, such as tourism, have been recovering steadily during these last four years. The same Bureau of Labor Statistics data set shows union membership is not back at prepandemic levels. In 2019, during the Donald Trump administration, there were 14,574,000 union members, about 162,000 more than the most recent data. During the last 10 years, union membership was at its highest in 2017 at 14,744,00 — some 300,000 union members more than now. Since 2013, the lowest number of union members were in 2020 and 2021 — amid the pandemic — at 14,012,000 and 14,285,000 respectively. Our ruling Su said, ""Four hundred thousand workers are now in a union that were not in a union when (Biden) became president."" That figure is correct however it does not mention that the increase is more indicative of unions — and the entire workforce — recovering from the pandemic than to any specific policy. Our definition of Mostly True is, ""the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information."" That fits here."

Ruben Gallego sought to link his U.S. Senate opponent, Republican Kari Lake, to the conservative policy blueprint. ""MAGA Republicans like Kari Lake support Project 2025, which would raise the retirement age for 73% of Arizonans,"" Gallego said Aug. 17 on X. Weeks later, Gallego revisited the talking point, writing on X on Sept. 10 that Lake appeared in a Project 2025 promotional video, a policy he said would ""cut Social Security benefits for the average Arizonan up to $100,000 over 10 years."" But the policy blueprint, offered by an outside group with close ties to former President Donald Trump, doesn’t recommend raising the retirement age or cutting Social Security. Trump endorsed Lake, a former local news anchor who lost her bid for Arizona’s governorship in 2022. Gallego, a former U.S. Marine, has represented a House district that includes Phoenix since 2015. Sign up for PolitiFact texts Trump has said multiple times he does not endorse Project 2025, although some policies overlap with his agenda. At least 140 of his former employees helped create Project 2025, CNN reported. Lake appeared in a March 2023 promotional video for Project 2025 that was filmed at the Conservative Political Action Conference, an annual political gathering in Washington, D.C. In the video, Project 2025 Associate Director Spencer Chretien said the group was speaking with people who are ""interested in serving the next conservative president."" During the video, Lake says, ""You have to have thick skin. We have to get beyond being bothered by what words they're going to call us."" PolitiFact searched for more statements from Lake about Project 2025 but found none. Here’s why the link to raising the retirement age for Arizonans is a misleading stretch. Does Project 2025 propose raising the retirement age? PolitiFact reviewed the more than 900 pages of Project 2025’s ""Mandate for Leadership,"" and found it doesn’t detail a plan for Social Security. Gallego’s campaign didn’t comment specifically on his X post but pointed PolitiFact to an article from the Arizona Mirror, which cites a study from the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. The study connects politicians who are in the Republican Study Committee, a group of conservative House Republicans, to people involved with Project 2025. The Republican Study Committee proposed a fiscal year 2025 budget proposal that would limit access to Social Security benefits by raising the retirement age from 67 to 69 years old, said Andrew Eschtruth, deputy director of the Center for American Progress’ Center for Retirement Research The Center for American Progress’ calculations show that the committee’s proposed retirement age increase would affect an estimated 73% of Arizonans — the same statistic Gallego cited in his X post. Separately, the Heritage Foundation published an article on its website advocating to raise the retirement age from 65 to 69 or 70 years old, which some critics have used to draw a connection between Project 2025 and raising the retirement age. The article’s author, Rachel Greszler, was one of several ""special mentions"" in Project 2025’s chapter on the Labor Department and is an overall contributor. Our ruling Gallego said, ""MAGA Republicans like Kari Lake support Project 2025, which would raise the retirement age for 73% of Arizonans."" On the campaign trail, Lake hasn’t explicitly endorsed Project 2025, but she has appeared in a Project 2025 promotional video. Even so, the Project 2025 blueprint doesn’t recommend raising the retirement age. The closest connection we could find is that Project 2025’s main sponsor, the Heritage Foundation, has publicly supported raising the retirement age from 65 to 69 or 70.

,TRUE,Elizabeth Warren,"“JD Vance actually sent a letter last year to the Department of Justice saying, ‘enforce the Comstock Act.’”",,2024-08-25,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/aug/30/elizabeth-warren/jd-vance-joined-republican-letter-urging-doj-to-en/,,"U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said she isn’t buying the Republican presidential ticket’s position on abortion. NBC ""Meet the Press"" host Kristen Welker asked Warren on Aug. 25 what she thought of former President Donald Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, saying in an earlier interview that Trump wouldn’t sign a federal abortion ban. Warren said, ""American women are not stupid,"" and that the candidates have an anti-abortion track record. ""JD Vance actually sent a letter last year to the Department of Justice saying, ‘enforce the Comstock Act,’"" Warren said. ""And remember, he did that, and then Donald Trump picked him to be his vice president."" The Comstock Act is an 1873 antivice law that bans the mailing of ""obscene"" materials used in abortions. Anti-abortion advocates have tried to resurrect the law to prohibit sending materials such as abortion-inducing medication and surgical equipment. In January 2023, Vance joined about 40 congressional Republicans in sending a letter urging the U.S. Justice Department to enforce the Comstock Act to crack down on mailing abortion pills, which are used in the majority of U.S. abortions. The letter Vance signed was in response to the release of a Justice Department memo saying U.S. law doesn’t prohibit the mailing of abortion medication as long as the sender doesn’t intend for the medication to be used illegally. ""Because there are manifold ways in which recipients in every state may lawfully use such drugs, including to produce an abortion, the mere mailing of such drugs to a particular jurisdiction is an insufficient basis for concluding that the sender intends them to be used unlawfully,"" Christopher Schroeder, assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel, wrote in the Dec. 23, 2022, memo. The Justice Department was studying the question after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022 and the U.S. Postal Service asked the department to address whether the Comstock Act criminalizes the mailing of mifepristone, the first pill in a two-drug regimen for a medication abortion. Sign up for PolitiFact texts But Vance and other Republicans said the Justice Department’s interpretation departed from the law’s plain-text meaning. ""We demand that you act swiftly and in accordance with the law, shut down all mail-order abortion operations,"" Vance and fellow Republican lawmakers wrote to Attorney General Merrick Garland. Signatories included current House Speaker Mike Johnson from Louisiana, Florida Sens. Rick Scott and Marco Rubio, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. The Republicans cited other federal criminal conspiracy and money laundering laws and asked the department to rescind or redraft the memo. They said department officials should hold accountable physicians, pharmacists and others ""who break the Federal mail-order abortion laws"" and demanded it cease its efforts to ""prevent States from regulating or prohibiting abortion drugs."" On July 7, Vance told NBC he supported access to abortion medication, citing a June Supreme Court ruling that left mifepristone on the market. But the court rejected a legal challenge of the pill’s FDA approval on procedural grounds, not on the case’s merits. Thus, the court could face the question again. Since becoming the Republican vice presidential nominee, Vance hasn’t weighed in specifically on the Comstock Act. PolitiFact contacted the Trump campaign but did not hear back. Our ruling Warren said Vance sent a letter to the Justice Department asking it to enforce the Comstock Act. Vance in 2023 signed onto a letter to the department with about 40 other Republicans. The letter challenged the department’s interpretation of the law and demanded that it shut down all mailing of abortion pills. Since becoming the Republican vice presidential candidate, Vance has said he supports a Supreme Court decision that left abortion medication on the market. Warren’s statement is accurate. We rate it True."
,HALF TRUE,Rick Scott,"“This month alone, more than 16,000 non-citizens have been removed from the voter rolls in 3 states.”",,2024-08-28,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/aug/29/rick-scott/sen-rick-scott-said-3-states-removed-thousands-of/,,"Republican politicians from multiple states say noncitizen voting is rampant and they are doing whatever they can to stop it. U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., wants lawmakers to vote on a federal bill that aims to prevent noncitizen voting. Congress blocked noncitizens from voting in federal elections in 1996. ""Illegals SHOULD NOT BE VOTING in American elections,"" Scott wrote Aug. 28 on X, linking to a clip of an interview with Newsmax. ""This month alone, more than 16,000 non-citizens have been removed from the voter rolls in 3 states. It’s a serious problem — and as the next Senate GOP Leader I’ll make sure we fix it."" Scott, who is running for reelection this year, wants to replace Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky as the Senate Republican leader. Despite evidence that noncitizen voting is rare, Republicans and social media influencers are making it a cornerstone of their election-year messaging. Sign up for PolitiFact texts Scott’s Senate office confirmed that he was referring to voters in Texas, Virginia and Alabama. We found that Scott’s number has some merit, but he misconstrued some of the details: Scott said the removals happened in August. Republican state officials in these states announced their actions only this month. Texas and Virginia officials said they had been removed during the past few years. Scott used the word ""removed."" Texas and Virginia officials said they removed the voters. But Alabama moved them from active to inactive status. Alabama’s secretary of state said some of the people might have since become naturalized citizens and are therefore eligible to vote if they update their information. Texas called the voters ""potential noncitizens."" It’s unclear how many of the 16,000 people voted in an election The voters flagged for citizenship questions add up to less than 1% of those states’ voter rolls. Texas, Virginia and Alabama state officials have been looking for noncitizens on voter rolls Here is what we know about the efforts to remove noncitizen voters in three states: Texas: Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said Aug. 26 that the state removed about 1 million ineligible people from the voter rolls since 2021. Most of them were removed because they had died or moved or didn’t respond to notices sent by election officials. Additionally, Abbott wrote, ""of the over 6,500 potential noncitizens removed from the voter rolls, approximately 1,930 have a voter history."" Those 1,930 were sent to the state attorney general for potential legal action. The word ""potential"" raises the question about whether they were proved to be noncitizens. The Dallas Morning News, a PolitiFact Texas partner, reported that those 6,500 people were sent a notice that their voter registration was under examination but did not respond. The notice states that they had 30 days to provide information or documentation establishing their qualifications for voter registration. A previous effort to clean up Texas’ voter rolls went poorly in 2019 when the state started with an error-filled list of 95,000 potential noncitizens on the voter rolls. The effort led to lawsuits and the secretary of state’s resignation. This time, Texas’ list is much smaller. Alabama: Republican Secretary of State Wes Allen said in an Aug. 13 statement that his office identified ""3,251 individuals who are registered to vote in Alabama who have been issued noncitizen identification numbers by the Department of Homeland Security."" Allen did not say how many voted. Allen instructed county boards of registrars to change the status for those voters to inactive and begin removing noncitizens from the rolls. Allen sent the list to the state’s attorney general for potential prosecution. Allen said it’s possible that some of the people have since become naturalized citizens and are therefore eligible to vote; but they have to update their information. Barry Stephenson, chairman of Jefferson County’s Board of Registrars, told PolitiFact his county had 557 voters on that list. ""They are not being removed — they are moving from active status to inactive,"" Stephenson said. As long as they fill out the form attesting to their citizenship, they can vote. Stephenson told PolitiFact that a couple of people who received a notice called the office and said that they had green cards and didn’t know they were registered to vote. They said they never asked to register to vote while getting a driver’s license. Jefferson County has 47,000 people on the inactive list, so the names the state flagged for citizenship are a small slice. Virginia: Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in an Aug. 7 executive order that the state removed 6,303 noncitizens from voter rolls from January 2022 to July 2024. Youngkin’s order did not say whether any people cast ballots. Virginia used state Department of Motor Vehicles records and federal Department of Homeland Security data to identify noncitizens. Youngkin’s order stated that they may have ""purposefully or accidentally registered to vote."" Voting by noncitizens is rare Elections experts say it is possible for an ineligible voter to accidentally register to vote at the DMV, which could be a mistake by the applicant or the clerk. And it’s possible DMV records on citizenship are outdated. ""All they know is what your citizenship status was whenever you interacted with the DMV,"" said Jonathan Diaz, an election law expert at the Campaign Legal Center, which promotes voting access. (The center has sent letters to Alabama and Texas officials challenging their recent actions.) Anthony Gutierrez, executive director of Common Cause Texas, agreed with Diaz: ""The fact that a voter was, at some point, not a citizen, certainly does not mean they voted during the time they were not a citizen."" In 1996, Congress banned noncitizen voting in federal elections as part of a broader toughening of penalties on people in the country illegally. ""Noncitizens"" includes people legally and illegally in the U.S. Safeguards already exist to prevent noncitizen voting. When people register to vote, they attest that they are citizens. Think tanks, academics, courts and journalists have analyzed claims about noncitizen voting at least since 2016 and have found only sporadic cases that wouldn’t swing federal elections. Penalties for noncitizen voting can include jail time, deportation or denial of citizenship applications. One of the largest examples we could find of noncitizens charged for voting stems from North Carolina. In 2020, federal prosecutors charged 19 people in North Carolina with voter fraud after they cast ballots mostly in the 2016 election. Sixteen people pleaded guilty, mostly to misdemeanors related to voting as a noncitizen. Three cases were dismissed. More than 4.5 million people in North Carolina voted in the 2016 presidential election. State election officials routinely take steps to remove ineligible people from the voter rolls in accordance with federal law. It could take several months or longer for authorities to determine whether any of the people the three states found on the voter rolls will face criminal charges. Additional information about these efforts could come out in potential lawsuits, meaning it could be years before some unknowns about the current removals are answered. Our ruling Scott said, ""This month alone, more than 16,000 non-citizens have been removed from the voter rolls in 3 states."" Scott is talking about something that did happen, but there is a lot we don’t know about the 16,000 total from available information. The outcome of investigations and potential lawsuits could take months or years. Based on what we know, Scott’s timeframe is off. Not all of these voters were taken off the rolls in August. State officials announced actions related to these voters in August. Texas announced it had removed 6,500 ""potential noncitizens"" since 2021. The word ""potential"" leaves some wiggle room. Virginia said it had ""removed"" 6,303 voters since 2022. The names in Alabama — 3,251 — were moved from active to inactive status, but that’s not the same as being removed. They can still vote as long as they sign a form attesting that they are U.S. citizens. Being on the voter rolls and casting a ballot are not the same thing. We don’t know how many of the potential noncitizen voters cast ballots; Texas said 1,930 had a Texas voter history. When we add up the numbers on the lists in the three states, it amounts to less than 1% of registered voters. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.

The article, which details that year’s Senate candidates’ abortion positions, paraphrased McCormick’s response in a Republican primary debate in 2022. The article’s author wrote: ""David McCormick — who's facing a heated primary with his Trump-backed opponent, Mehmet Oz — said during a debate in Harrisburg last month he's fully against all scenarios involving abortion, apart from ‘in the very rare instances there should be exceptions for the life of the mother.’"" Sign up for PolitiFact texts During that 2022 debate, the moderator asked McCormick whether he believes there should be exceptions to abortion laws for rape, incest and when the pregnant woman’s life is at risk. McCormick said he believes in ""very rare instances there should be exceptions for life of the mother."" He did not mention support for exceptions in cases of rape and incest. During the 2024 campaign, though, McCormick has softened his abortion position and said if elected, he would oppose a national abortion ban if it were proposed. He said in an Oct. 3 debate that he supports exceptions to abortion laws for rape, incest and the mother’s life. ""I support the three exceptions,"" he said. ""I would not favor an abortion ban of any kind, legislation to support a national abortion."" He said during that debate he believes abortion laws should be left up to each state. Pennsylvania law allows abortion until around 24 weeks of pregnancy, and after that if a pregnant woman’s health is endangered. The Pennsylvania law also requires parental notifications for minors seeking abortions and a 24-hour waiting period for all women seeking abortions. McCormick took more absolute stance before McCormick took a more absolute antiabortion stance in 2022 when campaigning for the Republican nomination for the Senate seat Democrat John Fetterman now holds. His 2022 campaign website said he was ""staunchly pro-life and believes life begins at conception."" It also said he will ""continue to advocate for the rights of the unborn."" It did not clearly state a position on an abortion ban. Elsewhere on the 2022 campaign trail, McCormick expressed support for changing abortion laws. He said at an event that year, ""We have to change the law on life, but more than ever we have to change the culture,"" according to an X post from liberal commentator Brian Tyler Cohen. McCormick told Fox News in 2022, after the leaked U.S. Supreme Court’s draft decision to overturn the federal abortion protections under Roe v. Wade, that overturning Roe ""would be a huge step forward and a huge victory for the protection of life."" Though McCormick did not mention support for rape or incest exceptions in his 2022 debate answer, his campaign has argued he supported those exceptions during that campaign. It also gave us an audio clip from a February 2022 event before the primary debate in which he said he supported those exceptions. In the audio clip, McCormick responded to an audience member’s question and said, ""I do accept three exceptions, the ones you just said. Rape, incest and the life of the mother."" Our ruling A Democratic PAC ad said McCormick ""is fully against abortion."" During a 2022 campaign, McCormick took a more absolute antiabortion stance and expressed inconsistent support for exceptions for rape and incest. But during the 2024 campaign, McCormick has said he would not support a national abortion ban. He said he believes abortion laws should be left for states to decide, and they should include exceptions for rape, incest and the pregnant woman’s life. Although the claim contains an element of truth based on McCormick’s past positions, it does not reflect his current position. We rate it Mostly False."
,MOSTLY FALSE,Senate Leadership Fund,U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown “supported allowing puberty blockers and sex-change surgeries for minor children.”,,2024-09-03,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/11/senate-leadership-fund/republican-super-pac-wrong-on-sen-sherrod-browns-g/,,"As part of a series of ads focusing on transgender issues, the leading political action committee for Senate Republicans attacked Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown over his stance on gender-affirming care for minors. Brown, who has held his Senate seat since 2007 and broadly supported LGBTQ+ rights throughout his career, is running against Republican businessman Bernie Moreno in a hotly contested swing state contest. In a TV ad, the Senate Leadership Fund described President Joe Biden as having ""an extreme liberal agenda"" that Brown supports. ""Brown backed Biden, voting to let biological transgender men participate in women's sports and supported allowing puberty blocker and sex-change surgeries for minors,"" the ad’s narrator said. We already checked the Senate Leadership Fund’s claims about Brown’s votes on transgender athletes, finding the claim False. The claim about gender-affirming care for minors is more complex. Sign up for PolitiFact texts The ad cited a July 19, 2023, interview Brown gave to WSYX-TV in Columbus, Ohio. We couldn’t find the full interview. The Senate Leadership Fund supplied a closed-caption transcript of the news segment, in which a reporter asked Brown about legislation from Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, that aimed to ban gender-affirming care for minors. S. 2357, the ""Protect Children’s Innocence Act,"" sought to make it a felony for doctors to provide surgery or prescribe puberty blockers to anyone younger than 18. ""A child's health care decisions are between them, their parents, their families and their doctors,"" Brown said, according to an archived snippet of the interview. ""Not politicians. I will never agree with anyone that wants to bring politics into the family situation with health care. Period."" Vance’s bill — which would have established punishment for doctors performing the procedures — was referred to a committee. It never received a vote. When PolitiFact asked Brown’s campaign whether Brown supports doctors providing gender-reassignment surgery and puberty blockers to minors, spokesperson Matt Keyes responded broadly. ""Sherrod cares about the health and well-being of all children. He does not believe the government has any role in a family's personal healthcare decisions,"" Keyes said. Brown has long supported policies advocated by LGBTQ+ rights activists, including marriage equality. In 2017, he introduced the Senate’s first Pride Month Resolution. Human Rights Campaign,the LGBTQ+ civil rights group, has endorsed him. But Brown has said relatively little specific to gender-affirming care for minors, though has generally said he supports allowing patients to make decisions with their doctors. The Senate Leadership Fund also pointed us to a March 31, 2023, letter Brown and eight other Democratic senators signed that asked the Biden administration to use executive action on several policies to ensure LGBTQ+ people’s access to health care. The letter noted that several states had enacted legislation ""to restrict access to gender affirming care for minors"" and asked President Joe Biden to allow Medicaid to cover expenses for patients traveling or moving to obtain gender-affirming care. Gender-affirming care is an individualized health care model that prioritizes encouraging and supporting a person’s gender identity — it is more than puberty blockers and surgery. The World Health Organization defines it as ""any single or combination of a number of social, psychological behavioural or medical (including hormonal treatment or surgery) interventions designed to support and affirm an individual's gender identity."" Before puberty, this care includes things such as using the name and pronouns that align with a child’s gender identity. At older ages, it can include evidence-based medical treatments such as puberty blockers or hormone therapies. Gender-affirming surgical procedures are not commonly recommended for or provided to minors. Gender-affirming surgery is very rare among minors in the United States. Our ruling The Senate Leadership Fund said in an ad that Brown ""supported allowing puberty blockers and sex-change surgeries for minor children."" The ad cited a local TV news interview Brown gave about a bill that would have banned gender-affirming care of all kinds. In the interview, Brown did not specifically address support for ""puberty blockers and sex-change surgeries for minor children."" He said only that he does not support the government intervening in personal health care decisions. In 2023, Brown signed a letter urging the Biden administration to broadly protect access to gender-affirming care. Gender affirming care is any kind of health care that prioritizes support for a person’s gender identity. It is not limited to surgery and puberty blockers; and surgery is rare among minors. We rate the claim Mostly False. RELATED: Republican super PAC twists Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown's votes on transgender athletes"
,MOSTLY TRUE,Eric Hovde,"""Typically you have three to four debates in a U.S. Senate race. (Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis. has) given me one debate, almost a month after early voting has started.""",,2024-09-03,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/sep/17/eric-hovde/does-the-baldwin-hovde-debate-take-place-after-vot/,,"Many eyes were recently on the debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, but there’s another debate coming up in Wisconsin. That’s the one between Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin and Republican challenger Eric Hovde, scheduled for Oct. 18. It will be hosted by WMTV in Madison and aired throughout Wisconsin. After the debate was announced, Hovde pushed Baldwin to participate in two more debates that he’s agreed to, in Milwaukee and Green Bay. And now, he’s arguing the debate happens after voting starts. ""Typically you have three to four debates in a U.S. Senate race. She's given me one debate, almost a month after early voting has started,"" Hovde said in a NewsNation interview on Sept. 3, 2024. Let’s tackle this claim in two parts. Sign up for PolitiFact texts First, has Baldwin agreed to fewer debates than normal for a U.S. Senate race in Wisconsin? And second, does the debate take place almost a month after early voting has started in Wisconsin? Baldwin has agreed to three debates in past campaigns for Senate, but four is a stretch PolitiFact Wisconsin contacted the Hovde campaign for backup, and spokesman Ben Voelkel cited examples of debates from past U.S. Senate cycles in Wisconsin. The most recent Senate race was in 2022, between Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson and Democratic challenger Mandela Barnes. Johnson agreed to up to three debates, and Barnes accepted two. Those took place Oct. 7 and Oct. 13, so slightly earlier than the Baldwin-Hovde debate but in the same time frame. In 2018, when Baldwin faced Republican opponent Leah Vukmir, there were three debates: Oct. 8, Oct. 13 and Oct. 19. In 2016, Johnson and Democratic challenger Russ Feingold participated in two debates: Oct. 14 and Oct. 18. In 2012, during Baldwin’s first run for Senate against former Gov. Tommy Thompson, there were three debates: Sept. 28, Oct. 18 and Oct. 26. So, in that race, a much wider time range than other cycles. It looks as if between two and three debates is normal in recent Senate races in Wisconsin. Hovde is on the mark when he says three is typical, but four goes a little too far. PolitiFact Wisconsin contacted Baldwin’s campaign for a response, and they cited only the two debates in the 2022 Johnson-Barnes race. They also noted there was only one debate between Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and Republican challenger Tim Michels in 2022. That debate took place on Oct. 14. Baldwin campaign spokesman Andrew Mamo sent a statement similar to one earlier this year, noting Baldwin ""travels the state constantly"" to meet Wisconsinites and the debate ""will air in every region of the state."" So, it doesn’t look as if more debates between Baldwin and Hovde will be added. Early voting starts after the debate, but voters could still return absentee ballots before it Now, let’s consider the second part of Hovde’s claim: Does the Oct. 18 debate take place ""almost a month"" after early voting starts in Wisconsin? Early voting is another name for in-person absentee voting, which can take place in Wisconsin from Oct. 22 through Nov. 3. Early voting involves going to your clerk’s office or another designated location and casting an absentee ballot in-person, before the election. It’s up to each city, village or town to decide how many dates, times and locations to offer early voting. Early voting cannot start more than two weeks before the election, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission. That date in 2024 — Oct. 22 — is after the Oct. 18 debate, and definitely not almost a month before the debate. But the full picture is a little more complicated. There’s still a way for voters to cast their ballots — voting absentee by mail — before the Oct. 18 debate. Hovde’s campaign cited the deadline to send out absentee ballots in federal elections. The state deadline is even earlier, Sept. 19, and clerks are told to mail absentee ballots as soon as they’re available. Clerks must send absentee ballots to voters with active requests by that deadline, and voters will start receiving them soon after. Certainly some voters will receive ballots by the Oct. 18 debate, though whether voters will get them in the mail a month before the debate is hard to predict. Voters could choose to fill out their ballot and return it immediately. But ""spoiling"" ballots — essentially taking your ballot back and voting a different way — is no longer allowed in Wisconsin. So, if a voter submits their ballot then changes their mind after the Baldwin-Hovde debate, there’s no reversing that vote. And again, the Oct. 18 debate doesn’t take place later than normal in Wisconsin — that falls in the same time frame as past election cycles. Our ruling Hovde said, ""Typically, you have three to four debates in a U.S. Senate race. (But Baldwin has) given me one debate, almost a month after early voting has started."" Baldwin agreed to three debates in her previous campaigns for Senate, though some recent statewide races have had two. Hovde is on par with three, but saying there’s typically four debates is a stretch. The debate does not start before in-person absentee voting in Wisconsin, also known as early voting. But some voters could still receive, complete and return absentee ballots before the debate, so that portion of his claim does have merit. Our definition of Mostly True is ""the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information."" That fits here."
,HALF TRUE,Sherrod Brown,"Of Bernie Moreno, “Now, he’s arguing for a national abortion ban, no exceptions.”",,2024-09-04,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/sep/19/sherrod-brown/sherrod-brown-claim-about-bernie-moreno-and-aborti/,,"In his race to win a fourth term as Ohio’s senator, Democrat Sherrod Brown said his Republican challenger has a hard line against legal abortion at any cost. During a September interview with a Columbus, Ohio, NBC television station, Brown criticized campaign opponent Bernie Moreno for opposing the state constitutional amendment that protected abortion access. ""Now, he’s arguing for a national abortion ban, no exceptions,"" Brown said. Brown is partly accurate in that Moreno has expressed support for a national law addressing abortion restrictions, but is misleading about Moreno’s current views on exceptions to anti-abortion laws. Although Moreno, a business owner who has not held elected office, has previously described himself as opposing exceptions, that’s not how he is campaigning in 2024. Moreno told the Columbus Dispatch in October, after he entered the Senate race, that he would support a federal law restricting abortions after 15 weeks with what he called ""common-sense restrictions."" In an email to PolitiFact, Moreno’s campaign spokesperson Reagan McCarthy said Moreno supports exceptions for rape, incest and the mother’s life. We asked Moreno’s campaign to clarify whether, should he win the race, he would vote for a bill banning abortion at 15 weeks with exceptions. But McCarthy did not address that question or respond to a follow-up. Sign up for PolitiFact texts ""Throughout this race, Bernie has made it clear that he supports commonsense exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the Mother,"" McCarthy wrote. Asked for evidence behind Brown’s claim, Brown’s campaign pointed us to 2021 and 2022 statements in which Moreno described himself as ""100% pro-life with no exceptions."" The campaign also pointed us to more recent statements from Moreno saying in 2023 that he would vote for a national abortion ban in the Senate. Brown campaign spokesperson Reeves Oyster also pointed to Moreno's opposition to a 2023 amendment to enshrine abortion access in Ohio’s constitution. Until voters approved the state constitutional amendment in 2023, Ohio had a law banning abortion once cardiac activity is detected in a fetus, which can be as early as six weeks. The law contained no exceptions for rape or incest, but it contained a narrow medical exception. The law was only enforced for a few months before being temporarily blocked in court in October 2022, while courts considered a lawsuit challenging the law. It remained blocked until voters approved the constitutional amendment last year. Brown’s campaign said in opposing the abortion access amendment, Moreno voted to uphold the six-week abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest. We examined how those claims stack up with Moreno’s record and his statements on abortion on the campaign trail. Moreno in 2021: ‘I’m 100% pro-life with no exceptions’ Moreno has a history of supporting strict abortion bans and said before 2024 that he did not support exceptions, including for rape and incest. When he ran in Ohio’s 2022 Republican primary for Senate, Moreno said he opposed exceptions to abortion bans. ""I’m 100 percent pro-life with no exceptions,"" Moreno told the conservative website Breitbart in December 2021. The article noted that Moreno confirmed in the interview he believed ""there should be no exceptions for rape or incest, or anything else."" In a later interview with radio host Kevin Gordon in 2022, Moreno said he was ""absolute pro-life, no exceptions."" In March, Moreno criticized his primary opponent for voting against Ohio’s law restricting abortion at around six weeks. Moreno also opposed the 2023 Ohio ballot measure to add to the state’s constitution protections for abortion access. He donated $100,000 to Protect Women Ohio, a group campaigning to defeat the measure. What is Moreno saying now? This year, as he seeks Ohio’s open U.S. Senate seat, Moreno has expressed support for banning abortion at 15 weeks, but he’s also said he favors some exceptions to that limit. In an October 2023 Columbus Dispatch article, after Moreno had entered the Republican Senate primary race, he was quoted in support of a 15-week federal ban, with exceptions. ""That's what can be passed in the House,"" Moreno said of a 15-week federal ban with exceptions for rape, incest and the pregnant woman’s life. ""That's what's going to be passed to the Senate, I believe. It's what gets signed by the president when we (win) the office back in 2025."" During a 2024 Republican primary debate in January, he said that, at the federal level, he supports ""getting to a point where we can have a 15-week floor, where there's common-sense restrictions after 15 weeks."" After the Republican National Committee removed from its 2024 platform a statement of support for a national abortion ban, a reporter asked Moreno whether his position contradicted the national party’s position. Moreno’s answer was less direct. ""We’re not here to talk about abortion,"" Moreno said. ""My position is crystal, crystal clear. It has not changed on abortion."" ""I do think that at some point, aspirationally, we can get to the point where after 15 weeks, there’s some common-sense restrictions"" on abortion, Moreno said in a Sept. 1 interview with NewsNation’s Chris Stirewalt. Moreno said in that interview he believes abortion is ""mostly an issue for the states,"" referring to how former President Donald Trump has talked about the issue. Moreno has said in other interviews he would allow states to be more restrictive with their abortion policies. Moreno frequently objects to the use of the word ""ban"" to describe his position. He calls it a ""15-week standard,"" or ""restriction."" In a March debate, he said calling his position a ban is a ""media, Democrat talking point."" Our ruling Brown said of Moreno: ""Now he’s arguing for a national abortion ban, no exceptions."" Moreno has supported strict abortion bans in the past. In a prior 2022 Senate run, he said he was ""100% pro-life with no exceptions,"" and he said he opposed exceptions for rape or incest. In his 2024 campaign, Moreno has said he supports federal limits on abortion after 15 weeks, with exceptions. Those exceptions include in cases of rape, incest and to save the pregnant woman’s life, according to his campaign. Brown was correct to say that Moreno has argued for a national limit on abortion, but he was wrong when he said Moreno’s position includes ""no exceptions."" The statement contains some truth but it omits key details. We rate it Half True. CORRECTION: This article has been updated to clarify Ohio's six-week abortion ban was temporarily blocked in court in October 2022."
,MOSTLY FALSE,House Majority PAC,"Laurie Buckhout is “trying to get to Congress to pass a national abortion ban, allowing politicians to ban abortions with no exceptions and prosecute women if they get an abortion, treating women right here like criminals.”",,2024-09-09,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/01/house-majority-pac/fact-checking-ad-about-republican-laurie-buckhouts/,,"Democrats are accusing the Republican candidate in a competitive North Carolina congressional district of supporting strict abortion bans. Republican Laurie Buckhout is challenging incumbent Democrat Don Davis in North Carolina’s 1st Congressional District, which stretches from the state’s Triangle region through most of northeastern North Carolina. Political analysts expect it to be the closest of North Carolina's 14 congressional races and could play a major role in determining which party controls the House of Representatives. House Majority PAC, a political action committee that helps elect Democrats to Congress, launched a television ad the week of Sept. 10 to attack Buckhout and boost Davis’s chances. A woman in the ad says, ""We don’t need an outsider like Laurie Buckhout trying to get to Congress to pass a national abortion ban, allowing politicians to ban abortions with no exceptions and prosecute women if they get an abortion, treating women right here like criminals."" The ad gives a misleading impression of Buckhout’s abortion stance. Sign up for PolitiFact texts National abortion ban To support the claim that Buckhout would pass a national abortion ban, the ad cites a Feb. 21 Hertford-based Perquimans Weekly newspaper article. Perquimans Weekly is produced by the Daily Advance newspaper in Elizabeth City, North Carolina. The newspaper asked Buckhout if she would support a national ban on abortion. Buckhout’s response was broad. ""As the only candidate to be endorsed by the pro-life SBA (Susan B. Anthony) List, I believe every life is precious and would vote to preserve life, including the mother’s,"" she said. House Majority PAC spokesperson CJ Warnke said Buckhout signaled her intentions for a national abortion ban by citing her endorsement from the Susan B. Anthony advocacy group. Susan B. Anthony says its mission is to ""end abortion."" Buckhout previously told Spectrum News 1 that she thinks a national ban should be discussed, the network reported. PolitiFact NC found no statement in which Buckhout cited a national abortion ban as one of her goals. Abortion ban exceptions But the ad did not mention this: In the same article in which Buckhout was asked about a national abortion ban, she specifically said she supports exceptions for abortion. ""I support consensus limits on late-term abortions, with reasonable exceptions, when scientific evidence proves the baby can feel pain,"" Buckhout said in the article. The ad not only fails to make that clear, its visuals give the opposite impression. When the ad’s narrator talks about abortion exceptions, the Perquimans Weekly citation appears on screen and text shows Buckhout’s name above the words: ""No exceptions for rape or incest."" Warnke argued the ad’s claim about ""no exceptions"" wasn’t about Buckhout’s statement in the newspaper — but what she would allow other politicians to do. ""Buckhout is ‘trying to get to Congress to pass a national abortion ban’ and is ‘allowing politicians to ban abortions with no exceptions and prosecute women if they get an abortion,’"" Warnke said. Because Buckhout agrees with the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 ruling that allowed states to restrict abortion as much as they want, Warnke said that means she’s OK with states banning the abortion in all circumstances. Ten states ban abortion without exceptions for cases of rape or incest, according to the health policy research group KFF. Every state that bans abortion includes an exception for the pregnant woman’s life, the group found. In a Nov.13 podcast interview, Buckhout said the Supreme Court ""did the right thing"" when it overturned Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 decision that held abortion access was constitutionally protected. Prosecuting women When the ad mentions criminal repercussions for women who get abortions, text on the screen points to an April 30 Time magazine article. PolitiFact NC found no references to Buckhout in Time. Asked about this, Warnke told PolitiFact NC that the ad referred to former President Donald Trump’s interview with Time magazine in which Trump was asked if states should monitor women's pregnancies to track whether they’ve broken abortion laws. Trump declined to give his opinion, citing states’ rights. ""It’s irrelevant whether I’m comfortable or not. It's totally irrelevant, because the states are going to make those decisions,"" Trump told Time. House Majority PAC argued that, because Trump endorsed Buckhout, she will follow his lead on the issue of allowing states to monitor women’s pregnancies. The ad’s narrator, though, doesn’t make clear that she’s talking about laws in other states. The narrator says Buckhout would allow politicians to prosecute women if they get an abortion, treating women ""right here"" like criminals. The ad misrepresents Buckhout’s position, campaign spokesperson Jonathan Felts said. ""Buckhout is pro-life, but has never said she is opposed to exceptions. And the pro-Don Davis group knows this. But they lie about it anyway,"" Felts said. Our ruling The ad accuses Buckhout of ""trying to get to Congress to pass a national abortion ban, allowing politicians to ban abortions with no exceptions and prosecute women if they get an abortion, treating women right here like criminals."" This is misleading. Buckhout has said a national abortion ban should be discussed and that she would ""vote to preserve life."" But her comments on this topic have been vague and lacking in detail. We found no evidence she’s actively campaigning in favor of a federal law restricting abortion, as the ad suggests. The PAC argued that Buckhout’s support of the 2022 Supreme Court ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade and returned to the states the responsibility for creating their own abortion laws shows she would enable state lawmakers to pass abortion restrictions that don’t include exceptions or that criminalize women. But Buckhout has explicitly stated that she supports exceptions for abortion. House Majority PAC produced no credible evidence that she has said she wants to prosecute women who break abortion laws. We rate this claim Mostly False."
,MOSTLY FALSE,Donald Trump Jr.,"“Less than three months ago, Kamala Harris and her administration blocked 300,000 unvetted Haitian migrants from being deported out of our country.""",,2024-09-09,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/sep/30/donald-trump-jr/biden-administration-prevented-haitians-deportatio/,,"In an X post, Donald Trump Jr. claimed Springfield, Ohio, is being destroyed by ""unvetted"" immigrants and it’s Vice President Kamala Harris’ fault. ""Less than three months ago,"" Trump Jr. wrote in a Sept. 9 post, ""Kamala Harris and her administration blocked 300k unvetted Haitian migrants from being deported out of our country. Today, those unvetted migrants are sucking up precious resources and destroying Springfield, Ohio. Kamala Harris did this."" Trump Jr.’s claim is among several misleading statements about Springfield, where a recent influx of Haitian immigrants has become campaign fodder for former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, as they seek to characterize the Biden-Harris administration’s immigration policies as harmful to U.S. interests. Trump Jr.’s X post included a screenshot of a June 28 NBC News story about the Biden administration’s decision to grant temporary protection for up to 300,000 Haitians already in the United States, effectively preventing their deportation. But Trump Jr.’s post mischaracterizes how the program, Temporary Protected Status, works. Haitian immigrants in the U.S. through this program are vetted by the U.S. government after submitting fingerprints and photos for background checks. The program also is available for people who are here legally and who don’t have a deportation order, such as people on student or tourist visas or who came in lawfully through humanitarian parole programs. PolitiFact contacted Trump Jr. through his website and emailed the Trump Organization, in which Trump Jr. serves as executive vice president, for further evidence. We received no reply. Others reshared Trump Jr.’s post, including Turning Point Action, a group founded by conservative commentator Charlie Kirk. Turning Point Action’s Instagram post sharing a screenshot of Trump Jr.’s statement garnered thousands of likes and was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Threads and Instagram.) Sign up for PolitiFact texts What is Temporary Protected Status? Congress established Temporary Protected Status in 1990. It gives the Homeland Security secretary the power to give people illegally in the U.S., and also people here legally on visas, a temporary refuge because of armed conflict, environmental disaster or other extraordinary conditions in their home countries. People granted the protection will generally not be subject to deportation and are allowed to temporarily lawfully live and work in the U.S. Temporary Protected Status is not a pathway for permanent legal residency in the U.S. To stay in the U.S. after protections expire, or to eventually gain citizenship, people have to secure a legal status through other avenues, such as asylum, marriage or employment. Haitians were first granted Temporary Protected Status in 2010 after an earthquake in Haiti killed more than 220,000 people and severely damaged infrastructure. Since that first designation, that protection has been extended several times because of other environmental disasters including Hurricane Matthew in 2016, civil unrest, the 2021 assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse and gang violence. In May 2017, the Trump administration renewed the Temporary Protected Status designation for six months. Trump later terminated the designation, but legal challenges stopped his administration from deporting people who were once protected. The Biden-Harris administration reinstated Temporary Protected Status for Haitians in 2021, and again redesignated Haiti in June. Redesignation made 300,000 Haitians eligible for protection in addition to 200,000 Haitians already protected under the previous Temporary Protected Status designation. Trump Jr.’s claim may have given people the impression that 300,000 Haitians were already on a path to be deported. But the Temporary Protected Status program is also available to people who don’t have deportation orders. People granted Temporary Protected Status must pass background checks Trump Jr.'s claim that Temporary Protected Status recipients are unvetted is inaccurate. To receive Temporary Protected Status, a person must complete Form I-821, a detailed 13-page questionnaire. ""You'll see that extensive biographical and background-related information needs to be provided, including information about any involvement with criminal systems,"" said Gemma Solimene, a Fordham University School of Law professor specializing in immigration law. For some of the questions — about history with human rights violations, terrorism, financial benefit from illicit activity and drug-related offenses — answering untruthfully could result in perjury charges. People who have certain criminal records, such as convictions for possessing small amounts of cannabis, are initially ineligible for Temporary Protected Status. But they can file an additional application seeking a waiver. The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services said on its website that it ""may grant a waiver of certain inadmissibility grounds for humanitarian purposes, to assure family unity, or when it is in the public interest."" People convicted of certain crimes, such as terrorism and participation in genocide, do not qualify for waivers. A different humanitarian parole program allows people lawfully in the U.S. to sponsor people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela to travel to the U.S. for up to two years. Both sponsors and beneficiaries are subject to security vetting, fingerprint and other biometric screening. About 210,000 Haitians have been vetted and approved by the U.S. government under this parole program, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said this month. Officials suspended the program for a month because of fraud concerns. It resumed in late August with improved vetting, the government said. Overall, experts pointed to deportation data that shows that even before the June announcement of the Temporary Protected Status extension, the deportation of Haitians in the U.S. illegally had slowed with the government heeding to calls from the United Nations to cease deportations to Haiti until security conditions ""significantly improved to permit a safe and dignified return."" The U.S. government also ""does not have the arrest, detention, and removal capacity to formally deport from the U.S. interior 300,000 people of a single nationality over a short period of time,"" said Michelle Mittelstadt, director of communications at the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute. Our ruling Trump Jr. said, ""Less than three months ago, Kamala Harris and her administration blocked 300,000 unvetted Haitian migrants from being deported out of our country."" The Biden-Harris administration in June said that up to 300,000 additional Haitians could be granted Temporary Protected Status, which effectively prevents their deportation.

,TRUE,Kamala Harris,“Donald Trump said he was going to allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices. He never did. We did.”,,2024-09-10,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/sep/30/kamala-harris/trump-never-managed-to-implement-rx-drug-price-neg/,,"Since Vice President Kamala Harris entered the presidential race, she and former President Donald Trump have sparred over their approaches to lowering prescription drug costs. Harris has described this as an important campaign promise that Trump made but didn’t deliver. ""Donald Trump said he was going to allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices,"" Harris said during the ABC News debate on Sept.10 in Philadelphia. ""He never did. We did."" She previously told CNN that Trump’s promise to pursue such negotiations ""never happened"" during his administration. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly promised, if elected, to take steps to allow the government to negotiate drug prices. He never enacted such a policy in office. The Trump administration pursued smaller, temporary programs aimed at lowering drug costs. However, experts say the effect of Trump’s moves fell far short of the expected effect of the Medicare drug price program included in President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act or of what Trump promised. Sign up for PolitiFact texts Medicare drug price negotiation policy, explained The Inflation Reduction Act — a sweeping climate and health care law Biden signed in August 2022 — included a measure authorizing the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to negotiate Medicare’s prescription drug prices directly with pharmaceutical companies. ""The idea behind drug price negotiation is that Medicare can use its buying power to get a better price than what is currently being negotiated for these drugs,"" according to Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the program on Medicare policy at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. Medicare covers more than 66 million Americans, giving it enormous potential influence over prices for U.S. drugs and medical services. In August, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced it had secured significant discounts on the list prices of 10 drugs because of its negotiations. Those discounts ranged from a 38% reduction in cost for blood cancer medication Imbruvica on the low end to a 79% cut for diabetes drug Januvia on the high side. (List prices and the prices Medicare drug plans pay can differ.) The new prices are expected to save Medicare $6 billion in the first year, with Medicare beneficiaries set to save another $1.5 billion in out-of-pocket costs, according to the White House. Those new prices aren’t set to take effect until 2026 — though Biden and Harris have highlighted other aspects of the law that are bringing down drug costs sooner, such as a $35-per-month out-of-pocket price cap on insulin for Medicare enrollees and a $2,000 yearly out-of-pocket spending cap for Part D drugs effective in January. The Part D program covers most generic and brand-name outpatient prescription drugs. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will start negotiating prices for the next group of drugs — 15 per year for the next two years — in early 2025, and those talks will continue annually through the end of the decade. Trump’s promises versus his actions As a presidential candidate in 2016, Donald Trump pledged to pursue prescription drug negotiation programs — and sometimes overstating such a policy’s power to cut prices. During multiple campaign rallies and media interviews that year, Trump suggested allowing the government to negotiate drug prices directly with manufacturers would save upwards of $300 billion per year, a claim fact-checkers said was ""absurd"" then. ""The problem is, we don't negotiate,"" Trump said during an MSNBC town hall in Charleston, South Carolina, on Feb. 17, 2016. ""We're the largest drug buyer in the world. We don't negotiate."" He went on to say: ""If we negotiated the price of drugs, Joe, we'd save $300 billion a year."" Similarly, at a February 24, 2016, rally in Virginia Beach, Virginia, Trump reiterated his interest in making this change. ""If you bid them out we'll save $300 billion … and we don't even do it. We're going to do it."" The pharmaceutical industry would push back, he said, but added: ""Trust me I can do it."" In office, however, Trump backed away from those promises, rejecting a bill then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., had proposed to authorize such negotiations. The Democratic-led House ultimately passed that legislation, though the Republican-led Senate didn’t consider it. ""Pelosi and her Do Nothing Democrats drug pricing bill doesn’t do the trick,"" Trump wrote on Twitter. Trump pursued smaller initiatives that sought to lower drug costs. One such program, the Most Favored Nation Model, tried to cap the cost of some Part B medications — those administered in a doctor’s office or hospital — at the lowest price paid in other peer nations (countries with a per-capita GDP of at least 60% of the U.S.’s). ""Medicare is the largest purchaser of drugs anywhere in the world by far,"" Trump said in announcing the program. ""We’re finally going to use that incredible power to achieve a fairer and lower price for everyone."" The Trump campaign didn’t respond to an inquiry about prescription drug negotiations or the Most Favored Nations model. The program would have started in January of 2021 and lasted for seven years. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services officials estimated the government would save more than $85 billion on Part B spending. But some of those savings came from assumptions that Medicare beneficiaries would lose access to some Part B medications under the model, with some manufacturers unlikely to sell products at the lower, foreign prices. Trump’s program never took effect. Amid lawsuits from several drug companies and industry groups, a federal judge stayed the plan in December 2020. The Biden administration scrapped it in 2022. Even if the Most Favored Nation model had been enacted, experts say it wouldn’t have come close to saving Americans or the government as much money as the IRA’s drug negotiations provisions. A contemporaneous analysis of Trump’s program estimated that 7% of the 60 million Medicare beneficiaries in 2018 would have benefited. More importantly, the Most Favored Nation model did not authorize the government to negotiate prescription drug prices with manufacturers — the policy Trump promised to implement. Our ruling As a presidential candidate in 2016, Donald Trump promised to let the government negotiate prescription drug prices directly with pharmaceutical companies. As president, however, he instead tried to tie some U.S. drug prices to their costs in other countries. Drugmakers and industry groups sued, challenging the move, and courts blocked it. Harris, therefore, is correct that Trump never was able to open Medicare up to drug negotiations despite his sweeping campaign promises. We rate Harris’ claim True. CORRECTION, OCT. 1: This story was updated to correct the following quote attributed to Trump: ""If you bid them out we'll save $300 billion."""
,HALF TRUE,Elissa Slotkin,Mike Rogers supported “laws that could eliminate IVF and birth control.”,,2024-09-11,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/sep/13/elissa-slotkin/claim-that-ivf-and-birth-control-could-go-away-und/,,"Michigan Democratic U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, is attacking her U.S. Senate opponent, Republican Mike Rogers, on his past support for restricting abortion, saying he backed laws that could affect access to other health care services. In a TV ad that began airing Sept. 11, Slotkin’s campaign said that while he was in Congress, Rogers supported ""laws that could eliminate IVF and birth control."" IVF stands for in vitro fertilization. The ad offered a list of anti-abortion positions Rogers took when serving in Congress from 2001 to 2015. To support the claim about IVF and birth control, the ad cited Rogers’ support for ""fetal personhood"" bills, including the 2013 Life At Conception Act, which Rogers co-sponsored. That bill, which never received a vote in the House, said ""the right to life guaranteed by the Constitution is vested in each human being"" beginning at the moment of fertilization. The bill would have granted constitutional protections to embryos from the moment of conception. Sign up for PolitiFact texts Legal experts told PolitiFact that legislation posed a threat to IVF, a fertility treatment that involves freezing multiple fertilized embryos and choosing some to implant with the goal of beginning a pregnancy. It also could have limited access to some forms of birth control. During Rogers’ time in Congress, he supported several measures to restrict and outlaw abortion. Rogers has distanced himself from that position during this Senate campaign and says he respects Michigan’s voter-approved 2022 constitutional amendment to protect abortion access. Rogers said in 2023 he did not vote on the constitutional amendment because he was a Florida resident then, adding he ""probably wouldn’t have"" voted for it if he could. In a statement to PolitiFact provided by a Rogers campaign spokesperson, Rogers said he believes decisions about a woman’s pregnancy ""should be made solely by her, her family, her doctor, and her God."" He said he will respect Michigan’s laws as senator, including ""protecting and expanding access to IVF."" Slotkin’s campaign declined to comment. How fetal personhood bills limit IVF While in Congress, Rogers supported at least four bills that would have defined an embryo as a ""person"" at the point it is fertilized, giving the embryo rights and legal protections from the moment of conception. He co-sponsored legislation with that language in 2005, 2008, 2009 and 2013. None of these proposed laws included specific protections for fertility treatments. Legal experts told PolitiFact that laws defining personhood as beginning at conception would likely severely restrict access to IVF. IVF involves collecting eggs and fertilizing them in a lab, then implanting one or more embryos in the uterus. The unused embryos can be frozen for future use, donated or discarded. Classifying embryos as people would present ethical dilemmas involving the transport, storage and destruction of embryos used in IVF, Drexel University law professor David S. Cohen said. Cohen said personhood legislation would ""be the death of the IVF industry."" ""If the person who wants to be pregnant no longer wants to have any more pregnancies, destroying the embryos, which is a normal part of IVF, would be illegal, because you can’t destroy a person,"" he said. Earlier this year, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that people could sue fertility clinics under the state’s Wrongful Death of a Minor Act after their embryos were accidentally destroyed, because the court considered the embryos ""unborn children."" After swift public backlash and some fertility clinics pausing treatments, the Republican-controlled Alabama Legislature passed a law shielding IVF providers from liability for embryo destruction. Some anti-abortion groups argue that IVF could continue despite laws that grant personhood to embryos. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, advocates for legal restrictions on the IVF industry, including limiting the number of embryos created during treatment, preventing destruction of embryos and limiting the number of embryos implanted at a time. Mary Ziegler, a University of California, Davis law professor and abortion historian, said it’s possible IVF could continue under personhood laws. ""There are different ways I've seen people suggest that this could happen,"" Ziegler said. ""You’d have to implant every embryo you created or maybe you could implant or donate to another couple every embryo that you created, because that would be consistent with the idea that the embryo is a person."" Providing IVF treatments under personhood laws would be impractical and likely would lead to worse outcomes for people trying to conceive, according to a 2023 paper by fertility doctor Gerard Letterie and law professor Dov Fox. The paper notes that under fetal personhood bills, people could donate unused embryos, or treatment centers could create a limited number of embryos during the initial stages of treatment, but each of those options presents challenges. The paper points to Italy, which enacted a 2004 law that required IVF treatment providers to create no more than three embryos at a time and implant all embryos during each treatment. The law made the process less efficient, less successful for older patients and resulted in some people leaving the country to access IVF elsewhere. The paper’s authors said that limiting the number of embryos produced during IVF treatment is ""​​a flawed process divorced from the patient’s interest of best outcomes in the shortest period with maximum future options."" Letterie, a reproductive endocrinologist and IVF provider in Seattle, told PolitiFact the personhood laws could expose providers to criminal liability if they mistakenly destroy embryos. He said he believes IVF providers would decide the risk is too high and stop offering treatment. ""The burden of laboring under that potential legal action, no one’s going to do that,"" he said. ""It will sadly, I think, result in the end of what we do."" Would personhood bills limit birth control access? Fetal personhood laws’ impact on birth control access is less clear, but at least some forms would be at risk of criminalization. Most hormonal birth control methods, such as the birth control pill, work by preventing ovulation. This means there is no egg to be fertilized, which prevents pregnancy. Based on that understanding, these forms of birth control shouldn’t be affected by legislation that grants legal rights at contraception. Some forms of contraception, including certain types of intrauterine devices and emergency contraception, may prevent pregnancy after fertilization by blocking a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus. Emergency contraception also can prevent ovulation. If a fertilized egg is treated as a person, emergency contraception potentially could be banned. ""If you’re talking about the birth control pill, you don't have an embryo yet, so scientifically there shouldn’t be a ban, but I think we’ve seen pretty clearly that legislators who want to ban things like birth control or the morning after pill or abortion kind of play fast and loose with those facts,"" American University law professor Jessica Waters said. All that said, the bills Rogers supported would not have banned either IVF or birth control. They would have set a standard that judges would have to follow to determine those procedures’ legality. That means one judge might consider some forms of birth control or IVF to violate a personhood law, while another judge might not, Waters said. ""That’s the point of this really broad language, it allows for a fair amount of discretion on the part of judges or prosecutors,"" she said. ""But then it’s the question of how is that discretion used."" Our ruling Slotkin said Rogers supported ""laws that could eliminate IVF and birth control."" From 2005 to 2013, Rogers supported legislation that would define embryos as legal people from the moment of conception, giving embryos constitutional rights. Now, Rogers says he would support protecting and expanding IVF access. IVF as it’s currently practiced involves destroying embryos, and that would be unworkable under laws that define personhood as beginning at conception. IVF could still be legal under personhood laws, but experts said the procedure would likely be more expensive and have lower success rates, and providers could exit the industry because of liability risk. Some forms of birth control that prevent pregnancy after eggs are fertilized could be at risk of criminalization. But other forms of contraception that prevent ovulation likely would not be affected. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True."
,HALF TRUE,Kamala Harris,Former President Donald Trump “started out with $400 million on a silver platter and then filed for bankruptcy six times.”,,2024-09-12,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/sep/20/kamala-harris/kamala-harris-exaggerates-scale-of-donald-trumps-i/,,"Vice President Kamala Harris has periodically needled her opponent in the presidential race, former President Donald Trump, over his business record. During a rally Sept. 12 in Charlotte, North Carolina, Harris touted her plan to provide a $50,000 tax deduction for small business startups, then segued into a knock on how Trump started his own business career. ""You know, not everybody started out with $400 million on a silver platter and then filed for bankruptcy six times,"" Harris said. Harris used a similar line the same day in an appearance in Greensboro, North Carolina, two days earlier in her debate with Trump, and in a livestreamed conversation Oprah Winfrey hosted Sept. 19. During the debate, Trump responded, ""I wasn't given $400 million. I wish I was. My father was a Brooklyn builder. Brooklyn, Queens. And a great father, and I learned a lot from him. But I was given a fraction of that, a tiny fraction, and I built it into many, many billions of dollars."" Sign up for PolitiFact texts What Harris said about six bankruptcies is accurate, but she took some liberties with what’s known about Trump’s inheritance from his father, real estate developer Fred Trump. Harris’ campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Did Trump start out with $400 million? The definitive 2018 analysis of Trump’s finances by New York Times journalists David Barstow, Susanne Craig and Russ Buettner found that Trump had received roughly that sum from his father or from his father’s estate, but it was spread out over the course of his life, not when he was starting out in the business world. ""The Times’ investigation, based on a vast trove of confidential tax returns and financial records, reveals that Mr. Trump received the equivalent today of at least $413 million from his father’s real estate empire, starting when he was a toddler and continuing to this day,"" the article said. The Times detailed two streams of money that went to Trump before he went to work for his father, in 1968 after graduating from the University of Pennsylvania — money he would have been able to access before he ""started out"" in the business world. One involved ""ground lease payments,"" a financial strategy in which Fred Trump built apartment buildings, then set up lease agreements for the land under these buildings. The beneficiary of those lease agreements were Fred Trump’s children — eventually five, including Donald — through a trust. Fred Trump set up ground leases for two of his developments in Brooklyn, the first of which became active when Donald Trump was 3 years old, the Times reported. The second mechanism for shifting assets involved what the Times called a ""mini-empire"" of real estate consisting of eight buildings with 1,032 apartments. Fred Trump would build or buy buildings in Brooklyn or Queens and then gradually transfer ownership to his children ""through a web of partnerships and corporations"" without fanfare, the Times found. This process began just before Donald Trump’s 16th birthday, the Times wrote. ""It was easy money for the Trump children,"" the Times wrote. ""Their father took care of everything. He bought the land, built the apartments and obtained the mortgages. His employees managed the building. The profits, meanwhile, went to his children. By the early 1970s, Fred Trump would execute similar transfers of the other seven buildings."" The Times calculated that when he was in high school, Donald Trump’s cut of the profits was ""about $17,000 a year in today’s dollars,"" rising to $300,000 a year soon after he graduated from college. The Times wasn’t specific about how much Trump would have received from his father by the time he entered the real estate business with the family company, but it appears to be somewhere in the $1 million to $2 million range once adjusted for inflation. That’s a lot — much more than Harris’ proposal of $50,000 for new startup businesses — but it’s far below the $413 million Harris cited. There’s an important caveat: Trump may not have had the money in his pocket when he started out, but he had a reasonable expectation of inheriting a share of Fred Trump’s business in the future. When Fred Trump brought Donald Trump into the family business following his college graduation as vice president of multiple subsidiaries, the elder Trump ""telegraphed what had become painfully obvious to his family and employees: He did not consider his eldest son, Fred Trump Jr., a viable heir apparent."" ""President Trump turned his inheritance into a multibillion-dollar empire — which is the definition of the American dream,"" Republican National Committee spokesperson Anna Kelly told PolitiFact. Did Donald Trump undergo six bankruptcies? This is accurate, as we reported in 2016, when Trump’s then-opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton, began using a similar attack line. Trump’s six bankruptcies were: The Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, 1991. The Trump Castle casino in Atlantic City, 1992. The Trump Plaza and Casino in Atlantic City, 1992. The Plaza Hotel in New York City, 1992. Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts, with properties in Atlantic City and in Indiana, 2004. Trump Entertainment Resorts, the successor company to Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts, 2009. When Trump was first running for president, experts told PolitiFact in 2016 that Trump didn’t bear 100% of the fault for the bankruptcies; even the most successful business owners experience duds, and some of that stems from conditions in their industry beyond their control. ""The only difference is that Trump puts his name on his companies, which means people associate them with him, but he's not at all the leader in the bankruptcy space,"" said Adam Levitin, Georgetown University law professor. Our ruling Harris said Trump ""started out with $400 million on a silver platter and then filed for bankruptcy six times."" There is no question that the former president had a strong financial wind behind him when he started out, and he always had a reasonable expectation of inheriting a share of his father’s business. But he didn’t begin his business career with $400 million available to him. A comprehensive New York Times review of the Trump family finances in 2018 found that Donald Trump received $413 million from Fred Trump or his estate over the course of his lifetime. However, all but perhaps $1 million or $2 million of that amount reached the son after he had already begun working for the family business. Trump’s companies have filed for bankruptcy six times, as Harris said. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True."
,HALF TRUE,Joyce Craig,"Gubernatorial candidate Kelly Ayotte “has voted for national abortion bans, she has voted to defund Planned Parenthood, and she shepherded Neil Gorsuch through the Supreme Court process, and then celebrated when Roe v. Wade was overturned.”",,2024-09-15,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/23/joyce-craig/fact-checking-joyce-craigs-claims-on-kelly-ayotte/,,"In New Hampshire’s competitive gubernatorial race, one of Democratic nominee Joyce Craig’s main lines of attack against her Republican opponent, Kelly Ayotte, has been on abortion. During a Sep. 15 question-and-answer session with WMUR-TV, Craig, a former Manchester mayor, said Ayotte ""has voted for national abortion bans, she has voted to defund Planned Parenthood, and she shepherded Neil Gorsuch through the Supreme Court process, and then celebrated when Roe v. Wade was overturned."" PolitiFact and WMUR-TV are partnering to fact-check claims in the 2024 New Hampshire gubernatorial race. Several of Craig’s assertions are accurate, but some need context. Ayotte voted on bills to restrict abortion, but it’s an exaggeration to call them ""bans."" The Craig campaign pointed to several votes by Ayotte when she was a U.S. senator: Sign up for PolitiFact texts In a mostly party-line vote, in 2013, Ayotte voted with most Republicans to attach an amendment to a budget bill that would include the nonbinding ""sense of the Senate"" that the Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act should be enacted. That vote failed. The bill would have prohibited transporting a minor across state lines to obtain an abortion if the home state had a parental notification law, unless it was deemed necessary to save the minor’s life. Also, the bill would have fined and/or imprisoned for up to one year a physician who performed or induced an abortion on an out-of-state minor without parents being notified according to state law. Also in 2013, Ayotte was an original co-sponsor, along with a large majority of Republican senators, of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. This legislation would have banned abortion after 20 weeks with exceptions for the pregnant woman’s life, the pregnant woman’s physical (but not mental) health or in cases of rape or incest. Abortion providers who violated this law would face a fine or up to five years in prison. Ayotte joined 32 other senators in writing a letter that said it ""is time that we in Congress act to bring the United States out of the fringe and closer to international norms on late abortions."" The bill did not come to a vote in the chamber. In 2015, Ayotte voted for a new version of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, with similar provisions. Again, the vote failed, mostly along party lines, with Democrats in the majority. Ayotte’s vote on the Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act doesn’t support the assertion that she voted for a national abortion ban. First, it focused on state-by-state notification rules; second, the vote was on a nonbinding statement of support. The other two votes Ayotte cast came closer to the Craig campaign’s description, but calling the bill a ""ban"" is imprecise. As we’ve reported, an abortion ""ban"" is not a medical term; people across the political spectrum on abortion tend to define it differently and the blunt term leaves room for political spin. Political discourse experts have told PolitiFact the term ""ban"" is now used as shorthand for nearly all abortion prohibitions. The types of laws being proposed today are more stringent than the one Ayotte supported more than a decade ago, with shorter windows for allowing abortions and fewer, if any, exceptions. Forty-one states now ban abortion at different points in pregnancy — 14 enforce total bans, three enforce six-week bans and others restrict abortion before fetal viability. More than 90% of abortions today occur in the first trimester, and about 99% occur before 21 weeks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. So, the bill Ayotte supported in 2013 and 2015, if enacted today, would have allowed all but a small percentage of abortions to proceed. Ayotte has voted to defund Planned Parenthood This issue arose in 2016, when Ayotte was running as an incumbent senator against Democratic challenger Maggie Hassan. During that campaign, PolitiFact rated the statement that Ayotte ""has voted to defund Planned Parenthood"" six times Mostly True. Some of these votes were procedural; others were substantive. Two were in 2011; four took place in 2015. Meanwhile, in September 2015, Ayotte voted not to move forward with a temporary government spending bill that sought to block federal funds for Planned Parenthood. Ayotte said then she supported defunding Planned Parenthood, but didn’t want to shut the government down to do it. Ayotte was a Senate ‘sherpa’ for Neil Gorsuch’s Supreme Court nomination This is correct. Ayotte headed the Trump administration’s team helping Gorsuch win confirmation to the court. This position, often called a ""sherpa,"" is often handled by a former senator who has ties to many of the senators who will be voting on the nomination. Earlier this year, Ayotte said she was ""proud"" of that work. Gorsuch was one of three Trump Supreme Court nominations who were integral in the Roe v. Wade’s overturning in 2022. Ayotte has said she supports the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade Ayotte has generally applauded the Supreme Court for sending abortion law back to the states. ""The Supreme Court turned this issue back to the states, and I believe that the states are where they should be,"" Ayotte told New Hampshire Public Radio in August. Ayotte also said during a WMUR debate in September, ""I have always thought that this should be an issue left to the states, and that is exactly what the Supreme Court did."" Ayotte has consistently said that, as governor, she would not seek to change New Hampshire’s law, which permits an abortion for any reason up to 24 weeks of pregnancy, and after that if the the pregnant woman’s life is in danger or in cases of fatal fetal anomalies. Our ruling Craig said Ayotte ""has voted for national abortion bans, she has voted to defund Planned Parenthood, and she shepherded Neil Gorsuch through the Supreme Court process, and then celebrated when Roe v. Wade was overturned."" Ayotte has voted on multiple occasions to defund Planned Parenthood and she was the ""sherpa"" for Gorsuch’s confirmation in the Senate. Ayotte has also applauded the Supreme Court’s decision to hand responsibility for abortion law to the states. But it’s misleading to say that Ayotte voted for a national abortion ban. Twice, Ayotte voted for a bill to end abortions after 20 weeks, with exceptions after that for life, physical health, rape and incest. This bill, if enacted today, would have allowed all but a tiny percentage of abortions to proceed. Craig’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True."

""Reminder that Project 2025 would dismantle the National Weather Service and NOAA,"" wrote the League of Conservation Voters on X. NOAA is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, founded in 1970. ""As Florida prepares for a major hurricane to make landfall this week, don’t forget that Donald Trump’s Project 2025 would eliminate the National Weather Service and NOAA,"" Brian Tyler Cohen, a liberal YouTube influencer, posted on Instagram. We heard a similar statement about Project 2025 from U.S. Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., during a Sept. 19 House Oversight Committee hearing. Sign up for PolitiFact texts ""Project 2025 wants to get rid of NOAA, wants to get rid of the National Weather Service — the people that tell you the weather and help you prepare for hurricanes,"" said Moskowitz, a past Florida emergency management director under Gov. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla. Moskowitz quipped about how hurricane forecasting would function under Project 2025 and a Trump administration. ""Maybe we will just do it with a Magic 8 ball or maybe with a Ouija board. Or maybe we will do hurricane cones like President Trump did, right where he just circled in another state that wasn’t in the cones,"" Moskowitz said. Moskowitz’s swipe at Trump referred to a Sharpie-doctored map Trump displayed in 2019, when he falsely said all hurricane models predicted Dorian would hit Alabama. (And Moskowitz wasn’t the first to come up with that Magic 8 ball line.) Partisan jostling aside, what does Project 2025 say about NOAA and the National Weather Service? A Moskowitz spokesperson, Keith Nagy, said ""while Project 2025 does not call for the complete dismantling of the NOAA, it intends to undermine the agency's independence from the executive branch and eliminate many of its internal departments. Any threats toward the NOAA or NWS jeopardizes life-saving information about hurricanes, heat waves, and other extreme weather events."" A NOAA spokesperson declined to comment. Project 2025 calls for breaking up NOAA, commercializing forecast operations Project 2025 is the conservative Heritage Foundation’s policy blueprint for a Republican administration. Trump has disavowed it, but it was written by several former Trump administration officials. In 2022, when Trump gave a keynote speech at a Heritage event in Florida, he said the organization would ""lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do."" Project 2025 includes about four pages on NOAA and the National Weather Service. That part was written by Thomas F. Gilman, who was an official in Trump’s Commerce Department. The document describes NOAA as a primary component ""of the climate change alarm industry"" and said it ""should be broken up and downsized."" The National Weather Service, one of six NOAA offices, provides weather and climate forecasts and warnings. The National Hurricane Center is part of the National Weather Service within NOAA. Project 2025 would not outright end the National Weather Service. It says the agency ""should focus on its data-gathering services,"" and ""should fully commercialize its forecasting operations."" It said that ""commercialization of weather technologies should be prioritized to ensure that taxpayer dollars are invested in the most cost-efficient technologies for high quality research and weather data."" Investing in commercial partners will increase competition, Project 2025 said. Project 2025 also said the National Weather Service should become a ""performance-based organization"" held accountable for achieving specific results, even if the head of the agency must ""deviate from government rules"" to achieve those results. The document said little about the National Hurricane Center. It said the administration should ""review the work of the National Hurricane Center"" and that ""data collected by the department should be presented neutrally, without adjustments intended to support any one side in the climate debate."" Experts criticized plans in Project 2025 We asked several experts who are familiar with the NOAA and the National Weather Service’s work about Moskowitz’s statement. They said Project 2025 doesn’t call for the National Weather Service’s termination, but limits its work. Craig Fugate served as former President Barack Obama’s administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and as then-Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s emergency management director. He recently served on a federal advisory committee, the Space Weather Advisory Group under NOAA. ""While Project 2025 doesn't call for the elimination of the NWS, it places restrictions on research, climate products, and potentially limiting access to the NWS forecasters and centers such as the National Hurricane Center,"" Fugate said. Private sector criticism of the National Weather Service isn’t new, Fugate said. A 2005 bill by then-Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., Fugate said, would have eliminated the free dissemination of weather information provided by the National Weather Service. The bill drew no co-sponsors and foundered. Rick Thoman, an Alaska climate specialist at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, said Project 2025’s vague language made it difficult to assess whether it called for eliminating NOAA and the National Weather Service. But ""the intent is clearly to cripple public weather forecasting,"" he said. Thoman cited examples of Project 2025’s vague phrasing on the National Weather Service: ""Should focus on its data-gathering services."" Thoman asked whether that means doing nothing but data gathering. If so, then the weather and climate models produced continuously by the National Weather Service that private companies rely on would go away, he said. ""Should fully commercialize its forecasting operations."" Thoman asked whether that means the National Weather Service should charge for forecasts or abandon weather forecasting entirely. Although Project 2025 seems to push collaboration with the private sector, that already happens. Private entities, including TV forecasters and AccuWeather, use NOAA data, Rachel Cleetus, policy director in the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said. (AccuWeather said it did not support what Project 2025 recommended.) ""The reality is NOAA and the National Weather Service are already working with a lot of commercial partners so it is unclear what exactly is the intention there,"" Cleetus said. She also said dismantling NOAA could render the agency ineffective. ""The idea that it could be broken up and somehow still be able to do this essential work, it won’t be possible,"" Cleetus said. Our ruling Moskowitz said, ""Project 2025 wants to get rid of NOAA"" and the National Weather Service. Project 2025 has a few pages about NOAA and the National Weather Service and some of its phrasing is vague. But it does call for major changes. It described NOAA as a primary component ""of the climate change alarm industry"" and said it ""should be broken up and downsized."" It doesn’t explicitly call for getting rid of the National Weather Service, but it says it should ""fully commercialize its forecasting operations."" We rate this statement Half True.

,MOSTLY TRUE,Donald Trump,Kamala Harris “supports taxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners and illegal aliens.”,,2024-09-20,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/18/donald-trump/harris-support-for-prisoner-access-to-transgender/,,"Ten minutes into Vice President Kamala Harris’ Oct. 16 interview with Fox News host Bret Baier, Baier played a segment of a Donald Trump campaign ad. ""Kamala supports taxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners"" the ad’s narrator said before it cut to a clip of Harris speaking to someone in front of a backdrop promoting the National Center for Transgender Equality Action Fund. ""Every transgender inmate in the prison system would have access,"" Harris said in the clip. Later in the ad, which was not shown by Baier, the narrator said, ""Even the liberal media was shocked Kamala supports taxpayer funded sex changes for prisoners and illegal aliens."" The Trump campaign released the ad Sept. 20 — 10 days after Trump made a similar claim during his Sept. 10 debate with Harris, when he said she ""wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in prison."" We rated that Mostly True. The central claim stems from statements Harris made during her 2019 Democratic presidential primary run in support of gender-affirming care access, including for federal detainees. Harris has not campaigned on this issue in 2024 — and she and her campaign have said little about it in response to reporters’ questions about Trump’s claims. Sign up for PolitiFact texts But when Baier asked her about it on Fox, Harris’ answered. ""I will follow the law,"" she said. ""And it’s a law that Donald Trump actually followed. You’re probably familiar with now. It's a public report that under Donald Trump's administration, these surgeries were available on a medical necessity basis, to people in the federal prison system."" Federal law requires inmates to receive access to necessary medical care, and courts have found that this can include medically necessary gender-affirming surgery. Legal obligations to provide this care were also acknowledged by the Federal Bureau of Prisons under the Trump administration. Any efforts to categorically eliminate access to gender-affirming surgical care would likely face legal challenges. The Bureau of Prisons’ policy under the Biden administration lets prisoners request gender-affirming surgery, but just two federal prisoners have successfully accessed these procedures and only after multiyear legal challenges, the first in 2022. PolitiFact could find no record of immigration detainees receiving transgender surgeries. Guidance from Immigration and Customs Enforcement requires people who have started hormone therapy to continue to have access and people who have not to be ""assessed and treated."" Surgery isn’t mentioned. Stays in immigration detention facilities are typically short. Harris’ history on gender-affirming care for federal detainees is more nuanced than ad suggests When Harris was California’s attorney general, she represented the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation as it sought to block a lower court order requiring the agency to provide gender-affirming surgery to a transgender inmate. The inmate was ultimately paroled during the appeals process making that case moot. But, as attorney general, Harris reached a 2015 settlement in a similar case, leading California to issue new guidelines and become the first state to provide limited gender-affirming surgical procedures to inmates if deemed medically necessary. ""I had a host of clients that I was obligated to defend and represent and I couldn’t fire my clients,"" Harris told reporters in 2019, when she was running for president and faced questions about her representing the Department of Corrections in that case. ""There were unfortunately situations that occurred where my clients took positions that were contrary to my beliefs. … But the bottom line is the buck stops with me, and I take full responsibility for what my office did."" Harris said she ""worked behind the scenes to ensure that the Department of Corrections would allow transitioning inmates to receive the medical attention that they required, they needed and deserved."" According to the nonprofit news organization CalMatters, 20 California inmates in state custody received gender-affirming surgeries from 2017 to 2022. Harris’ 2020 Democratic primary campaign promoted her role in expanding access to surgeries for California’s trans inmates. She gave an interview to the National Center for Transgender Equality Action Fund’s founding director, Mara Keisling, on Oct. 4, 2019 — a clip of which Trump’s campaign used in its ad. ""I made sure that they changed the policy in the state of California so that every transgender inmate in the prison system would have access to the medical care that they desired and need,"" Harris said. Harris said something similar in response to a 2019 American Civil Liberties Union candidate questionnaire. ""As President,"" the questionnaire asked, ""will you use your executive authority to ensure that transgender and nonbinary people who rely on the state for medical care — including those in prison and immigration detention — will have access to comprehensive treatment associated with gender transition, including all necessary surgical care? If yes, how will you do so?"" Harris checked ""yes"" and wrote, ""I support policies ensuring that federal prisoners and detainees are able to obtain medically necessary care for gender transition, including surgical care, while incarcerated or detained."" Shortly before the Sept. 10 Trump-Harris debate, Fox News hosts asked Harris’ spokesperson Michael Tyler about Harris’ response to the ACLU’s question. ""That questionnaire, this is not what she is proposing, it’s not what she’s running on,"" Tyler said. Multiple courts have found gender-affirming surgery to be medically necessary for prisoners The U.S. Supreme Court since the 1970s has ruled that prisons are legally required to provide necessary medical care to inmates, or risk violating the Constitution’s Eighth Amendment, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment against people accused or convicted of crimes. State and federal courts have also ruled in favor of inmates who sued for access to gender-affirming care. The medical community, including major medical organizations such as the American Medical Association consider gender-affirming surgery to be medically necessary health care as a treatment for gender dysphoria or gender incongruence. ""I had one client describe waiting for surgery as excruciating pain,"" said Shawn Meerkamper, managing attorney at the Transgender Law Center, a civil-rights advocacy group. ""These cases are just full of stories about people self harming, attempting self surgery, attempting to take their own lives… it is very much not cosmetic. It is very much not something that people pursue on a whim."" Still, the number of people affected by these policies are quite small — and the number of people who have sought and received this federally funded care is even smaller. The Federal Bureau of Prisons counts 2,261 transgender inmates in custody — about 1.4% of the total federal prison population. And the two inmates who received gender-affirming surgeries did so after long legal battles. Bureau of Prison policies on the treatment of transgender inmates have shifted between administrations. But Harris was right that the Trump administration also recognized the legal obligations to provide gender-affirming care. The New York Times on Oct. 16 highlighted a 2018 Justice Department budget memo that noted the ""statutory mandate to provide basic medical and mental health care"" to prisoners and noted that ""transgender offenders may require… surgery"" as part of medical treatment. The Bureau of Prisons under Trump issued a Transgender Offender Manual that referred to ""hormone or other medical treatment"" being provided, but did not specifically mention surgery. The Biden administration’s Transgender Offender Manual says the bureau may consider gender-affirming surgery requests from transgender prisoners who have one year of clear conduct. A council and medical experts will consider these requests, but not necessarily approve them, the manual says. But experts said that ultimately, a White House administration has little say over this matter — the courts have made the decision for them. ""The president does not control prisoners' access to gender affirming care,"" said Wanda Bertram, communications strategist for the Prison Policy Initiative, a criminal justice reform nonprofit. ""Courts have consistently upheld that people have a right to such care in federal detention (prison and immigration), and anyone who is president would, presumably, be bound by those rulings."" What about transgender surgeries in immigration detention facilities? The Trump ad didn’t specify what it meant by ""illegal aliens."" But when we asked Trump’s campaign about the claim, it pointed us to Harris’ comments about incarcerated immigrants. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has detention centers throughout the country where noncitizens are detained. But PolitiFact found no evidence online or in talking with experts of anyone receiving gender-affirming surgery in immigration detention. Neither had Bridget Crawford, the director of Law and Policy at Immigration Equality, an LGBTQ+ and migrant focused nonprofit. ""Immigration Equality has been working with LGBTQ immigrants for 30 years and is not aware of any gender affirming surgeries ever being performed for individuals in immigration detention,"" Crawford said. ""Given the very limited provision of healthcare in immigration detention, ICE is not set up to provide surgical care for transgender immigrants."" Stays in immigration detention are typically short — less than 50 days on average, far from enough time for a person to be medically evaluated and approved for a gender-affirming surgical procedure. A Transgender Care Memorandum issued by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in 2015 says that ""transgender detainees who were already receiving hormone therapy when taken into ICE custody shall be provided continued access, and all transgender detainees must have access … based on medical need."" Surgical care isn’t mentioned. Our ruling A Trump ad said Harris ""supports taxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners and illegal aliens."" After representing California in a case that fought a court order to provide such care in prison, Harris made numerous statements during her run for president in the 2019 Democratic primary run clarifying her position: She said she favored access to gender-affirming surgery for people in prisons and immigration detention. Harris has not campaigned on this issue in 2024, but when asked about it Oct. 16, she said, ""I will follow the law."" Federal law requires that prisons provide necessary medical care to inmates, and several courts have ruled that gender-affirming care, including surgery, is included. Despite these court rulings, access to gender-affirming surgery in prisons is very limited, and the number of transgender prisoners in federal prisons who have received it is minuscule — two. We found no record of gender-affirming surgeries being provided in immigration detention. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True."
,MOSTLY TRUE,Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee,"Wisconsin GOP U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde ""brags about being in the 1%.""",,2024-09-20,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/10/democratic-senatorial-campaign-committee/did-eric-hovde-brag-about-being-in-the-1-his-campa/,,"Twelve years might sound like a long time ago, but it isn’t enough for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. The committee put out an attack ad against Wisconsin Republican senatorial candidate Eric Hovde that says Hovde ""brags about being in the 1%."" In campaigning, labeling an opponent as part of ""the 1%"" is akin to a political slur, casting them as out of touch with the rest of the 99% and those whom the economy and personal finances are top of mind. Hovde, a millionaire banker and real estate mogul, is running against U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat. Did Hovde brag about being part of the 1%? Sign up for PolitiFact texts Quote comes from first senate campaign When we asked the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee for backup, it pointed us to an interview from 12 years ago. In 2012, Hovde dipped into political waters in Wisconsin, running in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate. He would eventually lose the primary to former Gov. Tommy Thompson, who then lost to Baldwin. On July 12, 2012, Hovde did an interview with conservative radio host Vicki McKenna on WISN-AM (1130) and talked about his family background. ""I love our country. It’s afforded my great-grandparents and grandpa, who immigrated here from Norway who came with nothing, I mean the shirt on their back and a little satchel, and to make a life for themselves,"" Hovde said. So far, it’s a pretty typical American story of generations coming to the country with limited resources. ""And then for my father to prosper and then for me to have an opportunity, that’s what America has been about,"" Hovde said. Then there is a shift in tone. ""And instead (Democrats) have totally distorted our economic system. I’m now supposed to feel guilty because I work hard and succeeded in life and have done good and employed people and helped support their families and given money away to people who are struggling,"" Hovde said. ""But now I’m bad because I’m the 1%? I mean, what’s happened?"" So, he did label himself as part of the 1%. But, it’s important to note that the quote was from more than a decade ago, while the ad positions it as if Hovde is continually making such claims — or at least has made them during this campaign. In July, Hovde had listed assets worth between $195.4 million and $564.5 million according to a financial disclosure form. In comparison, Baldwin reported in May having assets worth between $601,003 and nearly $1.3 million, according to financial disclosure records. We reached out to the Hovde campaign for a response to the ad but they did not address the point. Instead campaign spokesman Zach Bannon avoided the topic and asked a rhetorical question pointing to Baldwin’s donors, her partner and her $1.3 million condo in Washington, D.C. But when given the chance to respond, the Hovde campaign did not deny or add other context to the claim that he bragged about being part of the 1%. Our ruling The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee claimed Hovde ""brags about being in the 1%"" in an ad based on a quote from 12 years ago. The Hovde campaign doesn’t deny the claim or add additional context, but instead deflects onto his opponent. However the quote is 12 years old and the ad makes it seem as if Hovde said it more recently. We rate this claim as Mostly True."
,HALF TRUE,Tim Walz,"“Donald Trump added more to the national debt than any other president, ever.”",,2024-09-21,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/sep/25/tim-walz/fact-checking-tim-walz-on-which-president-added-th/,,"Seeking to counter Republican accusations that Democrats spend too much taxpayer money, Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz blamed former President Donald Trump for how much the federal debt increased on his watch. ""Donald Trump added more to the national debt than any other president, ever,"" Walz said Sept. 21 at a Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, rally. Whether Walz is right depends on the parameters and methods analyzed. One metric shows Trump added the most debt, but also says President Joe Biden will surpass that amount. Another metric has Trump as the president contributing the most to the national debt. Debt accumulated during a president’s tenure The most straightforward way to review Walz’s claim is by measuring how much the national debt rose on each president’s watch. Treasury Department data shows the gross federal debt rose by about $7.8 trillion during Trump’s presidency. To date, this is the largest increase during a single four-year presidential term. (President Barack Obama oversaw a debt increase of more than $9.5 trillion, which exceeded Trump’s one-term total, but Obama served two terms.) Sign up for PolitiFact texts So far, Biden has added less to the debt — $7.6 trillion — than Trump has. But Biden still has more than three months left in his term. Counting the prorated debt that the Congressional Budget Office expects to be added during that time, Biden’s one-term total is on pace to reach $8.1 trillion. That would be higher than Trump’s over an equivalent time period. Although this method is straightforward, it’s also less precise, because much of the debt accumulated on any president’s watch stems from policies instituted by their predecessors. In particular, much of the current federal debt stems from mandatory payments, such as those for Social Security and Medicare. These began spiking when baby boomers started drawing heavily from these programs around 2010. Generations of politicians in both parties approved and modified these programs long before Trump and Biden took office. Debt stemming from a president’s policies An alternative method seeks to skirt this challenge. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a think tank that studies fiscal policy, calculated how much Trump and Biden policies would increase the debt over the succeeding 10 years. The group found that during his four years in office, Trump approved policies that created $8.4 trillion of new borrowing needs — $8.8 trillion in borrowing minus $443 billion in deficit reduction. By contrast, the group calculated that Biden enacted policies that added $4.3 trillion of new borrowing over 10 years — $6.2 trillion in new borrowing minus $1.9 trillion in deficit reduction. Among the most costly programs Trump enacted were his tax cut legislation, which added a projected $1.9 trillion to the debt, and government spending bills for 2018 and 2019, which added a projected $2.1 trillion. Removing the legislation intended as pandemic relief from the calculation, as some economists recommend, Trump still created more borrowing obligations than Biden did, based on the committee’s calculations. Trump’s nonpandemic total was $4.8 trillion; Biden’s was $2.2 trillion. (Because previous presidents didn’t add nearly as much debt in any four-year period, it’s safe to estimate this is also the record for one term.) Much of the debt allocated to Trump and Biden will not show up in the federal ledger until years after they leave office. Our ruling Walz said, ""Donald Trump added more to the national debt than any other president, ever."" The increase in the federal debt on a president’s watch shows that Trump ranks first for debt in a single term, but Biden is projected to pass him by January 2025, when he leaves office. Using a different method — counting how much future debt a president’s actions created — Trump created about double the amount of future debt than Biden did. We rate the statement Half True."

Two real-life voting issues that cropped up on overseas ballots had some social media users concerned that someone was trying to hinder the Democratic candidates, Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. ""Is everyone aware that Montana(‘s) (secretary) of state ‘FORGOT’ to put Kamala Harris on the electronic ballots sent to overseas and ex-pats?"" a Sept. 22 Threads post said. ""Florida just tried to do something similar, they put Tom Walz instead of Tim Walz."" This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.) We found numerous social media posts that said the ballot errors were intentional, with one X post calling the Walz misspelling ""election interference."" Sign up for PolitiFact texts The ballot errors were real — Montana’s overseas ballots briefly omitted Harris’ name and a Florida county sent ballots listing ""Tom Walz"" instead of ""Tim Walz"". But the social media posts omitted that election officials caught the errors and quickly fixed them, leaving few voters affected. There’s no evidence either incident was intentional. Qualified overseas voters, including military service members and U.S. citizens residing abroad, can receive electronic ballots for U.S. elections, thanks to the federal Uniformed and Overseas Citizen Absentee Voting Act. In Montana, the state’s Electronic Absentee System went live Sept. 20. One problem: Harris’ name was missing as a candidate for president. Montana’s secretary of state’s office said a voter reported the issue shortly after the system went live, and the system was taken offline. The system was up and running again later that day with the correct ballot. Only a few voters were impacted, and no printed ballots were affected, officials said. Florida also sent overseas electronic ballots Sept. 20. But a problem soon emerged in Palm Beach County, home of the infamous butterfly ballots and hanging chads from the 2000 presidential election: Walz’s first name was spelled incorrectly — as ""Tom Walz"" — on Palm Beach County’s overseas electronic ballots. But there was no foul play afoot. The mistake was the result of a typo by an election vendor that shouldn’t have been typing in names to begin with, said the county’s Supervisor of Elections Wendy Sartory Link. Link is a former Republican appointed to the post by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2019. She switched parties to run for election as a Democrat in the left-leaning county in 2020, and is running for reelection in November. Link told PolitiFact that the county has one ballot file that is rigorously proofread — including by representatives for the candidates and the parties — for all ballots. But Enhanced Voting, the vendor that handles the county’s overseas ballots, chose to manually type in the vice presidential candidates’ names instead of using the file, Link said. ""The unfortunate part is we had no idea they had done that,"" Link said. ""So had we known that, we would have known, obviously, that it needed to be proofread again."" The vendor then sent overseas voters a link Sept. 20 to download the electronic ballots, which contained the error. Link said her office learned of the typo early the next morning. Link said her office determined that 257 people had opened the email with the misspelling before it was corrected. Some of those 257 people may have seen the corrected ballot by the time they downloaded it, she said. Link said an email was sent to those 257 voters notifying them of the updated link. Palm Beach County’s overseas voters don’t fill out an online ballot — people who request an electronic ballot must print it out and either fax or mail it back to the county. They can also request a printed ballot be mailed. Printed ballots are not produced by the same vendor and were unaffected by the error, Link said. At least three Palm Beach County voters had returned ballots with the misspelling before it was corrected, Link said Sept. 24. There could be more if voters printed them out and the office hasn’t received them yet. Regardless, Link said, those votes will be counted as voters intended, even if they voted for ""Tom"" Walz. Any voters concerned about their ballots are welcome to call the Palm Beach County office, Link said. The error was limited to the 257 Palm Beach County ballots, Enhanced Voting President Aaron Wilson said. Enhanced Voting provides electronic ballot delivery for many Florida counties and is used in 1,500 jurisdictions in 24 states. Travis Hart, the Lafayette County supervisor of elections and president of the Florida Supervisors of Elections, said he was unaware of the error happening in any other counties. Florida Department of State's Director of External Affairs Mark Ard said Sept. 25 that his office had not received reports of errors in any other counties. ""We regret the typo that led to these ballots going out with a candidate’s name misspelled, and we are glad it was reported and addressed so quickly,"" Wilson said. ""We have taken steps to ensure this does not happen again."" Link said her team would examine what they can do when working with vendors to avoid a repeat of the error in the future. ""The important thing is that it doesn't have any effect on the tabulation of the ballots,"" Link said. ""Obviously we hate that it happened. We strive for excellence, and we know our voters expect that from us, and so we do hold ourselves accountable, whether it was our error or not."" Our ruling A Threads post claimed Florida put ""Tom Walz instead of Tim Walz"" on its ballots. That did happen, but it didn’t happen statewide, as the post claimed, and it affected few voters. An election vendor inserted a typo on an online ballot available to overseas voters. The county’s elections supervisor said 257 overseas voters opened an email that contained a link to the ballot with the typo. The link was updated the day after the ballots were sent. As of Sept. 24, three voters had returned ballots with the spelling mistake, but officials said those would be counted as those voters intended. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate the claim Half True."
,MOSTLY FALSE,Kamala Harris,"“Even before the pandemic, (Donald Trump) lost manufacturing jobs, by most people’s estimates at least 200,000.”",,2024-09-25,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/sep/26/kamala-harris/kamala-harris-exaggerates-scale-of-prepandemic-man/,,"During Vice President Kamala Harris’ first solo television network interview since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, she sought to compare the nation’s manufacturing sector during her tenure with former President Donald Trump’s time in office. During the Sept. 25 interview, MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle asked Harris about Americans’ concerns about the economy. When Harris said Trump handed the incoming Biden-Harris administration a weak economy, Ruhle noted that that was during the pandemic. Harris replied, ""Even before the pandemic, he lost manufacturing jobs, by most people’s estimates at least 200,000."" Harris is correct that manufacturing stumbled under Trump before the COVID-19 pandemic. But the 200,000 jobs figure she cites includes manufacturing job losses during Trump’s entire presidency, not just the prepandemic period. The Harris campaign pointed PolitiFact to more accurate phrasing Harris had used earlier the same day, when she told an audience in Pittsburgh, ""All told, almost 200,000 manufacturing jobs were lost during his presidency, starting before the pandemic hit."" Was there a prepandemic manufacturing recession? Harris is on safe ground in pointing to a prepandemic manufacturing downturn, as we’ve reported. Manufacturing output was declining for more than a year before the pandemic’s 2020 start. Sign up for PolitiFact texts One way to measure this is a Bureau of Labor Statistics statistic, calculated quarterly, called inflation-adjusted output for all manufacturing workers. This statistic compares how much higher or lower output was in a given quarter with the same quarter in the previous year. This metric showed that manufacturing output reached an 11-year peak in 2018’s third quarter, during Trump’s presidency. The growth continued in the next quarter but slowed. Then, in 2019’s first quarter, the year-over-year change turned negative, partly because of a trade war with China, and it remained negative in each of the four subsequent quarters. A similar statistic — the Federal Reserve’s industrial production index — mirrored this pattern. This monthly statistic fell by about 2.4% from August 2018 to February 2020. Collectively, these metrics show weakening in the sector, Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, told PolitiFact in July. The prepandemic decline was ""chump change compared with the drop that occurred in the COVID-19 recession,"" Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C., think tank, told us in July. Still, these metrics show that ""real output was falling even before COVID-19 infections began to soar."" News outlets described a manufacturing recession at the time; a January 2020 report by The Washington Post was headlined, ""U.S. manufacturing was in a mild recession during 2019, a sore spot for the economy."" Where does the figure Harris cited originate? Harris’ remark paired an accurate observation — that manufacturing was declining before the pandemic — with an employment number that also included the pandemic years. Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that manufacturing sector employment fell by 48,000 from its prepandemic peak in January 2019 to February 2020, the month before the pandemic hit the U.S. That’s a quarter of the number of jobs Harris said were lost before the pandemic. Harris cited 200,000 job losses, a figure that is closer to the net losses for Trump’s entire presidency, which was about 178,000. Our ruling Harris said, ""Even before the pandemic, (Trump) lost manufacturing jobs, by most people’s estimates at least 200,000."" She’s right that the manufacturing sector tipped into a downturn at least a year before the pandemic, measured both by jobs and output. But the prepandemic job losses were 48,000. About 200,000 manufacturing jobs were lost during Trump’s entire tenure, not just the prepandemic period. This is significant because the pandemic losses were largely because of extenuating factors outside Trump’s control. We rate the statement Mostly False."

Kelly Ayotte, the Republican nominee for New Hampshire governor, has been seeking to draw a distinction with her Democratic opponent, former Manchester Mayor Joyce Craig, over immigration. One issue Ayotte has focused on is sanctuary cities, an unofficial term for jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with federal immigration officials. During a Sep. 25 debate sponsored by the Greater Nashua Chamber of Commerce, Ayotte cited debate over a bill in the Legislature to prevent New Hampshire municipalities from becoming sanctuary cities. ""When Mayor Craig said we’re not a sanctuary state, she went up in the legislature and there was a bill to basically create a ban to make sure we never become a sanctuary state, that no locality passes those regulations and she opposed that bill,"" Ayotte said. Craig did oppose the bill, but Ayotte’s assertion needs some context. Sign up for PolitiFact texts PolitiFact and WMUR-TV are partnering to fact-check claims in the 2024 New Hampshire gubernatorial race. What is a sanctuary city? There is no official definition or list of sanctuary cities, and there isn't a one-size-fits-all sanctuary policy. Broadly, jurisdictions are described as sanctuary cities when they have policies that restrict state or local police from assisting federal immigration officers; stop local or state officials from inquiring into a person's immigration status; or restrict information sharing between local or state law enforcement and federal authorities. Ayotte is referring to a 2023 bill, S.B. 132, which ""prohibits any state or local government entity from establishing sanctuary policies."" It defines ""sanctuary policies"" as prohibiting cooperation with ""the enforcement of federal immigration laws."" On May 24, 2023, the House Municipal and County Government Committee considered the bill after the Republican-controlled Senate passed it on a party-line vote. Craig’s name is on a committee list of individuals who opposed the bill. Craig’s campaign told PolitiFact that she opposed the bill in solidarity with law enforcement, particularly Manchester Police Chief Allen Aldenberg, who testified against the bill in person at the House committee hearing. Craig’s campaign said law enforcement officials told her that the bill would infringe on local control, require local police to do the federal government’s work without additional money, training or compliance, and jeopardize relationships between law enforcement and immigrant communities. Sheriffs from Cheshire and Strafford counties and police chiefs from Hollis, Dover, Portsmouth, Nashua, Merrimack and Hudson joined Aldenberg in opposing the proposed measure, according to a letter they sent to the committee. The New Hampshire Municipal Association, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Manchester, the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire and immigrant advocacy groups also opposed the bill. During the Nashua Chamber of Commerce debate, Craig responded to Ayotte’s comment by saying that the bill is one ""that I was with my police chief there supporting (him). I will always do whatever I need to do to make sure our communities are safe. ... I have always supported our community members and (have made) sure they have an opportunity to succeed, and that’s exactly what I will do as governor."" Is Manchester a sanctuary city? Craig may have opposed S.B. 132, but she’s said she’s comfortable with the federal cooperation her city maintains with federal immigration officials. Manchester’s policies on these issues have been in place since 2011, after being enacted under a Republican mayor. According to Aldenberg’s testimony, the city does not ask people about their immigration status when they are victims, witnesses or juveniles, or during routine traffic stops, medical transports or domestic violence complaints. Aldenberg said this is done so that people know that ""they can come to the police for help without the threat of being deported."" Beyond these cases, however, the Manchester police work with federal immigration officials. They will cooperate if officers believe someone under arrest for a felony or a violent misdemeanor may be in the country illegally. ""And this does happen,"" he testified. ""We do call (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) in these circumstances."" Craig’s campaign said in a statement to PolitiFact that she ""has never advocated changing Manchester’s police policies on this issue."" And in the Nashua debate, Craig said, ""New Hampshire is not a sanctuary state and it will not be a sanctuary state when I am governor."" Our ruling Ayotte said, ""There was a bill to basically create a ban to make sure we never become a sanctuary state, that no locality passes those regulations"" and Craig ""opposed that bill."" Craig opposed a 2023 bill that would have prohibited ""any state or local government entity from establishing sanctuary policies,"" alongside Manchester’s police chief and other law enforcement officials. However, Ayotte’s remark glossed over Craig’s support for her city’s 13-year-old policy, which includes cooperation with federal immigration officials when people are arrested in the city for felonies and violent misdemeanors. Craig has also said she would not turn New Hampshire into a sanctuary state if elected. We rate the statement Mostly True."
,HALF TRUE,New Hampshire Democratic Party,"When New Hampshire gubernatorial nominee Kelly Ayotte served on two companies’ boards, one “laid off 18,000 workers” and the other “laid off 1,200 American workers, moving jobs overseas.”",,2024-09-27,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/07/new-hampshire-democratic-party/new-hampshire-democrats-ad-omits-context-about-kel/,,"In New Hampshire’s nip-and-tuck gubernatorial race, the state Democratic Party attacked Republican nominee Kelly Ayotte over corporate board positions she held after losing reelection to the U.S. Senate in 2016. In a September ad backing the Democratic nominee, former Manchester Mayor Joyce Craig, the New Hampshire Democratic party said Ayotte served on company boards that laid off thousands of U.S. workers. (The ad says Craig authorized the party's ad.) Ayotte ""sat on corporate boards where they bought up companies, gutted them and then pocketed the profits,"" the ad said. ""Under Ayotte, they laid off 18,000 workers at one company. At another, they laid off 1,200 American workers, moving jobs overseas. All while Ayotte raked in $2.5 million."" When contacted for comment, the Ayotte campaign did not dispute the $2.5 million compensation figure. Here, we’ll focus on the ad’s claims about layoffs. The New Hampshire Democratic Party provided PolitiFact with evidence to support both layoff numbers, but in both cases, the numbers omit important context. Sign up for PolitiFact texts Screenshot PolitiFact and WMUR-TV are partnering to fact-check claims in the 2024 New Hampshire gubernatorial race. Blackstone didn’t oversee the layoffs of 18,000 MGM workers Ayotte served on the board for Blackstone, an investment company that had a joint venture with hospitality company MGM Resorts International, which laid off 18,000 workers in 2020. Two points undercut the ad’s attack. First, this wasn’t a case of a company cutting costs routinely or experiencing management problems. The layoffs occurred in August 2020, when MGM was reeling from major travel declines because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, blaming Ayotte or Blackstone Inc. for this decision isn’t accurate. In January 2020, shortly before the pandemic reached the United States, Blackstone said its real estate division had established the joint venture with MGM Resorts to take control of MGM’s real estate assets on the Las Vegas Strip, including the MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay hotel-casinos. In its announcement, Blackstone said MGM Resorts would continue managing the hotel-casinos’ day-to-day operations under the lease agreements, as the company had previously done with another Las Vegas hotel-casino, the Bellagio. MGM would pay Blackstone, the real estate owner, to lease back the properties. In essence, Blackstone became the properties’ landlord. But it did not manage the hotel-casinos’ staffing.. Caterpillar did lay off 1,200 workers, but overall U.S. employment rose The ad also only tells part of the story about heavy machinery manufacturer Caterpillar, for which Ayotte served as board member from 2017 to 2023. Caterpillar did lay off 1,200 workers, as paperwork filed with the U.S. government shows. This paperwork lets laid-off workers qualify for benefits under the federal Trade Adjustment Assistance program, which helps people who have lost jobs because of foreign competition. Between 2017 and 2020, Caterpillar’s federal paperwork filed for the layoffs cited disruptions such as declining in sales, rival competition and a shift of production to locations outside of the U.S. In the filings, the company said some of the U.S. workers’ duties were shifted to Belgium, Brazil, China, India, Ireland and Mexico. The ad ignores that overall, the company added U.S. jobs during Ayotte’s board tenure. Based on annual reports filed by the company, Caterpillar added 8,600 U.S. jobs during Ayotte’s board service, offsetting the loss of 1,200 lost jobs the ad mentioned. Our ruling A New Hampshire Democratic Party ad said that when Ayotte was serving on corporate boards, one company ""laid off 18,000 workers"" and another ""laid off 1,200 American workers, moving jobs overseas."" Ayotte served on the company board of Blackstone, which had a joint venture with MGM Resorts when MGM laid off 18,000 workers as the COVID-19 pandemic hit and travel slowed dramatically. But Blackstone served as MGM’s landlord; it did not operate the company or dictate its layoffs. Another company for which Ayotte served as a board member, Caterpillar, laid off 1,200 U.S. workers during her tenure, and many of the jobs moved outside the United States. However, the ad ignores that Caterpillar’s U.S. employment increased overall by 8,600 jobs during Ayotte’s board tenure. The statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context. We rate it Half True."

Supporters say the constitutional amendment would strengthen abortion rights and strengthen anti-discrimination laws for women and the LGBTQ+ community. Opponents include the Coalition to Protect Kids NY, which warns the amendment would override parental rights and harm girls’ sports. The group’s website claims: ""The ERA could also mandate that schools allow biological males to compete in girls' sports."" Would Prop 1 do this? The amendment adds language, bolded below, to the constitution that would increase protections against discrimination: ""No person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws of this state or any subdivision thereof. No person shall, because of race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, disability, creed [or], religion, or sex, including sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy, be subjected to any discrimination in [strike: his or her] their civil rights by any other person or by any firm, corporation, or institution, or by the state or any agency or subdivision of the state, pursuant to law.

Like other states around the country, New York has been in the news for transgender athlete bans. On Long Island, Nassau County lawmakers enacted a prohibition against trans athletes from playing on teams that align with their gender identity at county-owned sports facilities. This ban is being challenged in court. The county law states that athletes must play on teams that match their sex assigned at birth, or play on coed teams, even if they have a court order stating their gender identity. Before this law was passed, a state Supreme Court justice struck down an identical executive order from the county executive, deeming that County Executive Bruce Blakeman had exceeded his authority. New York State Attorney General Letitia James sued the county, claiming the ban violates the state’s human rights and civil rights laws. Courts have found that these laws protect people who are transgender from discrimination, James said. New York state already offers protections allowing high school athletes to choose which team aligns with their gender identity, experts told us. The state Legislature amended the Human Rights Law in 2019 to include gender identity as a protected class, through the Gender Expression Non-Discrimination Act, or GENDA. The law prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender identity in public accommodations, which include public buildings. The governing body for high school sports in New York, the New York State Public High School Athletic Association, has recognized transgender athletes since at least 2015. The group’s guidelines call for the inclusion of trans athletes on teams that align with their gender identity and outline a process for determining eligibility. State education law states: ""No person shall be disqualified from state public and high school athletic teams, by reason of that person's sex, except pursuant to regulations promulgated by the state commissioner of education."" Though protections for trans athletes to compete on teams that align with their gender identity already exist in the law, Prop 1 could strengthen those protections, because they would be part of the state constitution, said Elana Redfield, federal policy director at the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles. ""It’s more robust,"" Redfield said. Laws can be amended during legislative sessions, but constitutional amendments go through a more rigorous process. They are passed twice in the state Legislature and must be approved by the majority of voters in a referendum. A constitutional amendment would make it more difficult for opponents of these protections to reverse the law, said Jacqueline Drohan, a lawyer who is chair of the New York State Bar Association's Task Force on the Treatment of Transgender Youth in Sports. In addition to state laws, at least one court has interpreted federal Title IX protections to apply to trans athletes, though the law is not settled. A ruling from the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals found that a transgender athlete ban in West Virginia violated a middle school student’s rights under Title IX. The state is appealing the ruling. But even with constitutional protection, there is a balancing test, Redfield said. Courts will consider the state’s interests - in this case preventing discrimination - and its means of meeting that goal. ""No particular outcome is guaranteed and the individual facts of the case will matter,"" she said. The Coalition to Protect Kids NY did not respond to our inquiries. Our ruling The coalition opposing Proposition 1 claims the proposed amendment to the state constitution could mandate that schools allow biological males to compete in girls' sports. Voters may not realize the state already provides protections for transgender athletes to play on teams that align with their gender identity. The amendment would strengthen those protections, making them more robust against legal challenges. However, even with an amendment, courts would look at the facts of each case and balance the interests of all parties in a lawsuit. The statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True."
,MOSTLY FALSE,Elissa Slotkin,U.S. Senate candidate Mike Rogers “believes he should make that decision” about whether to end pregnancies.,,2024-09-30,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/sep/30/elissa-slotkin/us-rep-elissa-slotkin-ad-skews-opponent-mike-roger/,,"U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., targeted her Republican opponent for U.S. Senate, Mike Rogers, over his abortion position. In the ad that began running Sept. 25 on Facebook and Instagram, a woman identified as Sarah describes having to decide whether to end a pregnancy because of a medical problem. ""Mike Rogers believes he should make that decision"" about whether to end a pregnancy, the ad said. On-screen text in the ad said, ""Mike Rogers voted to ban abortion, even without exceptions for rape or incest."" Rogers served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2001 to 2015, and he consistently voted for abortion restrictions and co-sponsored bills that would outlaw abortion from the moment of conception. More recently, though, Rogers has said that he respects the constitutional protections for abortion access that Michigan voters approved in a 2022 referendum, and he said he would not vote to change those protections if elected to the U.S. Senate. Sign up for PolitiFact texts Rogers and Slotkin are in a competitive race to fill the Senate seat held by outgoing Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow. In an email to PolitiFact, Rogers campaign spokesperson Chris Gustafson said Rogers, if elected to the U.S. Senate, would vote no on a federal abortion ban. In a statement the campaign previously provided to PolitiFact, Rogers said he believes decisions about a woman’s pregnancy should be made ""solely by her, her family, her doctor, and her God."" ""Michigan voters have already decided this issue, and I respect their decision and will uphold and defend it as Michigan's Senator,"" Rogers said in the previous statement. Slotkin campaign spokesperson Antoine Givens said Rogers supported abortion restrictions at every point in his congressional career, and his voting record shows he believes the government should restrict abortion rights. ""Over 14 years in Congress, not once did he break from his party on the issue of abortion,"" Givens said. Rogers’ changing abortion stance During 14 years in Congress, Rogers supported several measures to outlaw and restrict abortion. He co-sponsored four ""life at conception"" laws that sought to give constitutional rights to embryos from the moment of conception. These laws were intended to make abortion illegal at any point in pregnancy and included no exceptions for rape, incest or to protect the pregnant woman’s health. He also voted for a 2013 bill to ban abortion nationally after 20 weeks. That bill initially included no exceptions for rape and incest, but the exceptions were added before the vote was taken. In a 2010 interview with MLive, a news outlet, Rogers said he believes federal and state governments ""were established to protect our lives and the lives of the unborn."" He said he believes ""abortions should be legal only to prevent the death of the mother."" Abortion politics have changed significantly in the nearly 10 years since Rogers left Congress. The U.S. Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022 and ensuing backlash to abortion restrictions in several states have prompted many Republicans to moderate their stance. During this Senate campaign, Rogers has moved away from his past position and said he will not vote to change Michigan’s constitutional abortion protections. Rogers reiterated his position on federal abortion laws in a recent ad. ""I know that a decision about a pregnancy is one of the most difficult and personal decisions a woman will make,"" he said. ""Michigan voters have already decided the issue, and I respect that decision. In the Senate, I won’t do anything to change it."" Michigan voters approved the amendment in 2022 with 57% voting in favor. It prohibits any state restrictions on abortion or other reproductive care until fetal viability, around 24 weeks. After that point, the state may restrict abortion unless it’s needed to protect the pregnant woman’s physical or mental health. Though Rogers has committed to not voting to overturn Michigan’s constitutional protections for abortions, he said in a 2023 interview he ""probably wouldn’t have"" voted for the ballot measure if given the chance because it was too permissive. He was living in Florida then. Our ruling Slotkin’s ad said Rogers ""believes he should make that decision"" about whether to end pregnancies. Rogers supported strict abortion bans in the past, and said he believed the government had a responsibility to restrict abortion access. More recently, he has said he will not support any federal legislation that would change the abortion protections voters added to Michigan’s constitution in 2022. The claim has an element of truth, as Rogers supported abortion bans for more than a decade serving in Congress, but it ignores his current position. We rate it Mostly False. CORRECTION, Sept. 30, 2024: We updated this article to correctly reflect Rogers’ statements to MLive on abortion in a 2010 interview."

""Why are MAGA Republicans spreading lies about hurricane recovery?"" Robert Reich wrote Oct. 8 on Instagram. ""Perhaps it is to cover up the fact that just two weeks ago 100 GOP lawmakers voted against additional FEMA funding."" Reich, an economist, served as labor secretary under former President Bill Clinton. He currently is a public policy professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and has a major social media following. We saw many other social media users making similar claims about GOP lawmakers’ FEMA funding votes, including Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign account on X. Reich’s post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.) Sign up for PolitiFact texts A Reich spokesperson confirmed that he was referring to a Sept. 25 vote on a stopgap funding bill to avoid a government shutdown. Reich distorts the nature of the legislation. That day, Hurricane Helene was churning toward the southeast. Congress voted to provide $20 billion to FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund as part of the bill to fund the government through Dec. 20. President Joe Biden signed the bill Sept. 26. In the Senate, the bill passed 78-18, with all of the ""no"" votes from Republicans. In the House, the bill passed 341-82, and again, all of the ""no"" votes were Republicans. So, Reich’s numbers are correct, as the Republican ""no"" votes total 100. In both chambers, some Republicans voted in favor of the bill, including House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. The bill was not only for FEMA funding. It also extended funding through Dec. 20 for programs including Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, military construction projects, veterans services and the National Flood Insurance Program. Some lawmakers opposed the stopgap funding bill for reasons unrelated to FEMA funding, and their public statements reflect that. Republicans who opposed the bill criticized the process or federal spending broadly, or raised concerns about immigration. Here are a few examples: Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz’s spokesperson sent us a statement saying Gaetz supported funding FEMA but ""the only option presented to me was to fund the entirety of the federal government with one vote"" and the ""take-it-all or leave-it-all dichotomy is an irresponsible way to fund the federal government."" Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn told a Knoxville TV station that she ""supports hurricane relief and will fight to ensure Tennesseans receive all federal assistance necessary to rebuild."" However, she said she doesn’t support a ""reckless spending spree."" Colorado Rep. Greg Lopez released a statement that said he could not vote for a bill that ""would extend the federal government’s current, exorbitant spending levels with no cuts or considerations for the elimination of expired programs."" Lopez also wanted the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act attached to the funding bill. The act, which passed the House in July and then stalled, aims to prevent noncitizen voting, although Congress has already banned that practice. On Sept. 18, a House Republican plan to avert a government shutdown was defeated when Republicans could not agree when the funding should end and what other conditions should be included. Johnson’s plan called for six months’ funding and included the SAVE Act. Similar to Republicans voting against the Sept. 25 funding bill, more than 200 Democrats voted to defeat the bill, and 199 Republicans voted in favor. Gregory Koger, a University of Miami political science professor, said both votes were on much broader legislative packages to fund the government, not FEMA funding by itself. ""In both situations, the key factors in these bills were a) the duration of the extension and b) whether or not the bill would include a new voting restriction imposed weeks before the election,"" Koger said. U.S. Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., proposed a standalone bill Oct. 1 that would provide $10 billion to FEMA for Hurricane Helene disaster relief. It has not received a vote. Our ruling Reich said, ""Two weeks ago 100 GOP lawmakers voted against additional FEMA funding."" Reich’s claim is partially accurate because Sept. 25, 18 Senate Republicans and 82 House Republicans voted against a stopgap funding bill to avert a government shutdown. But his statement leaves out important details. The bill was a much broader funding bill that also included $20 billion for FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund. Some Republicans said publicly that they opposed the bill for reasons unrelated to FEMA funding. A week earlier, a Republican majority voted for their own version of a stopgap funding bill that also included FEMA funding. Similar to Republicans voting against the Sept. 25 funding bill, more than 200 Democrats voted no. We rate this statement Half True.

On Oct. 8, Wisconsin Republican U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde took questions on several topics from members of the Rotary Club of Milwaukee and Milwaukee Press Club. He was asked about sex trafficking. He talked about how his foundation has been working with the group Thorn: Digital Defenders of Children, to combat child sex trafficking, and advocating for people to be vigilant when they’re out in public. ""There are a lot of organizations that are helping young people that have gone through this trauma, and just keep your eyes and ears open,"" Hovde said. ""I hate to say it but Milwaukee is one of the sex trafficking capitals in our country."" Is Milwaukee really a sex trafficking capital? Sign up for PolitiFact texts Sex trafficking is a difficult crime to quantify We tried to contact Hovde campaign multiple times to seek backup for the claim, but those requests went unanswered. Hovde is not the first person to spotlight Milwaukee when it comes to sex trafficking. In 2018, the Medical College of Wisconsin published a report that found ""340 individuals ages 25 and under were confirmed or believed to be victims of sex trafficking in Milwaukee between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2016."" Mallory O’Brien, then-director of the Milwaukee Homicide Review Commission, said then they have ""heard from different sources that we’re the mecca of sex trafficking but we need to be able to measure that."" The Milwaukee Police Department said there were 35 cases of human trafficking in 2023 and 30 cases of human trafficking in 2022. In the department’s most recent quarterly update, there have been 25 cases of human trafficking so far this year, which is about the same as where it was last year. Meanwhile, in 2023, the Wisconsin Department of Children and Families put out a report analyzing child sex trafficking from 2019 to 2021. According to the report, in 2019, Milwaukee County had 158 allegations of child sex trafficking, representing 33.3% of allegations statewide; in 2020 there were 124 allegations representing 28.8% of allegations statewide; and in 2021 there were 142 allegations representing 31.9% of all child sex trafficking allegations statewide. Compared with other crimes, human trafficking in the city is rare, police statistics show. But, yes, sex trafficking is a significant problem in Milwaukee. Let’s exmaine how Milwaukee compares with other cities. Comparing Milwaukee to other places The Polaris Project operates the National Human Trafficking Hotline, which according to its website is ""one of the most extensive data sets on the issue of human trafficking in the United States."" Its most recent data for Wisconsin, from 2023, shows the hotline received 256 tips which led to 109 cases and 211 victims. However, that is statewide data, not specific to any city or town. Sabrina Thulander, the Polaris Project’s associate communications director, said her group doesn’t rank states on this issue and the hotline ""is not representative of all trafficking that occurs."" ""Rather, it captures the situations and victims made known to the hotline when a person calls in to ask for help for themselves or others, or as a third-party reporter. This same principle would be true for any trafficking database,"" Thulander said. ""While it is possible that Wisconsin could have more reported situations and victims than other states, that does not mean it is a hub for trafficking. It could just mean more people are aware of what trafficking is and how to get help in this location."" Finding accurate data on this crime is difficult for law enforcement and victim advocates. So, designating Milwaukee as a ""sex trafficking capital"" is vague and difficult to measure. Our ruling Hovde claimed ""Milwaukee is one of the sex trafficking capitals in our country."" Although his office provided no backup, it’s accurate that human and sex trafficking crimes take place in Milwaukee and it is a significant problem. However, designating the city as a sex trafficking capital in the country is difficult to determine, as experts say this is a crime that’s hard to track and no one ranks cities in that manner. Our definition of Mostly True is ""the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information."" That fits here."

Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., and Republican candidate Kari Lake on Oct. 9 reached its zenith over abortion, a top issue in the swing state. Lake, who broadly supports abortion restrictions, redirected the conversation to abortion alternatives, voicing her support for expanding the child tax credit. Gallego raised questions about her record. Gallego said that Lake opposed the one-year child tax credit expansion in the Democratic-backed American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. ""We should make sure we continue with some of the great work we did with the child tax credit that brought childhood poverty down by 60% which, by the way, Kari Lake was against when the bill was on the floor,"" Gallego said. The claim is misleading. Lake opposed the American Rescue Plan, but she did not single out the child tax credit expansion. Sign up for PolitiFact texts The federal child tax credit reduces tax liability for families with children, and the American Rescue Plan increased the claimable amount in 2021 from $2,000 per child age 16 or younger to $3,600 per child younger than 6 and up to $3,000 for children age 6 to 17. The credit was also fully refundable, meaning low-income families qualified regardless of how much they earned in household income, according to the Tax Policy Center. The tax credit expired in December 2021. We didn’t find evidence that Lake spoke out against the credit or the bill as the bill was being considered. Lawmakers discussed the bill on the House floor March 10, 2021; we didn’t find Lake criticizing the bill around that time in our search for public statements and her social media accounts. Lake stepped down from her TV anchor position March 2, 2021, and announced her run for governor of Arizona in June. When we asked the Gallego campaign for evidence, a spokesperson pointed to Lake’s Sept. 25 housing press conference and a 2022 interview where she criticized government spending. She specifically mentioned neither the American Rescue Plan nor its child tax credit expansion. In a June 2024 X post, Lake criticized Gallego’s vote for the American Rescue Plan because it sent stimulus checks to prisoners. In March 2021, @RubenGallego voted for the American Rescue Plan, which sent about $1 billion in stimulus checks to prisoners, including the Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.Today, NBC reported that 8 men with ties to ISIS were arrested in American citiesWill Ruben… pic.twitter.com/2gys6hoqJG— Kari Lake (@KariLake) June 12, 2024 During the Oct. 9 debate, Lake blamed high living costs on the spending package, saying it ""actually sent us spiraling and put our economy on life support."" PolitiFact has found that the American Rescue Plan likely exacerbated the record inflation of June 2022, but it was not the only or largest factor. Lake has supported expanding child tax credits to incentivize women to carry pregnancies to term. In May, Lake told the Washington Examiner that the child tax credit needs to be enough to help people grow families and support the U.S. birth rate. In April — after the Arizona Supreme Court held a near-total abortion ban in the state that is no longer in effect — Lake’s campaign released a statement showing her support for ""extending the child tax credit."" In a 2023 interview with Arizona’s Family, Lake said she supports reducing tax liability for families with children via ""baby bonuses,"" citing the policy of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. A statement to PolitiFact from the Lake campaign said, ""We've checked around and Kari Lake has never criticized child tax credit expansion. She has always been in support of it."" Our ruling During the Arizona U.S. Senate debate, Gallego said Lake ""was against"" the child tax credit expansion put forth by Congress in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 ""when the bill was on the floor."" Lake criticized parts of the American Rescue Plan, blaming the one-time spending package for raising living costs and condemning it for sending stimulus checks to prisoners. However, she did not directly criticize the child tax credit expansion and has voiced support for reducing tax liability for families with children during her Senate campaign. Lake also did not criticize the American Rescue Plan on March 10, the day lawmakers voted on it in the House. We rate this claim Mostly False."

According to a Sept. 4 report from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Hovde is advocating for extending Republican President Donald Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which he says puts small and medium businesses on a more even playing field with larger corporations. Sign up for PolitiFact texts The law also lowered tax rates across the board and shifted the thresholds for several income tax brackets. While the cuts reduced taxes across the board, the largest savings were seen for those in the highest income brackets. That tax plan could add an additional $4 trillion to the U.S. debt, according to an Oct. 7 report from NPR. The report cited an analysis by the nonpartisan nonprofit Committee for Responsible Federal Budget, which found that Trump’s tax plan would cause about $7.5 trillion of debt over the next decade, while Vice President Kamala Harris’ would add about $3.5 trillion. So that $4 trillion number comes from that analysis — the difference between the plans shared by the Trump and Harris campaigns. As a part of that plan, Trump wants to make his tax cuts permanent, the report said. But that doesn’t really get into who those tax cuts benefit. According to a June 13 report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan research and policy institute, Trump’s 2017 tax cuts mostly benefited the rich. If left in place, the tax plan would leave those cuts in place. Households with incomes in the top 1 percent received a tax cut of more than $60,000, and households in the bottom 60% will receive a $500 average tax cut in 2025, the report said. ""As a share of after-tax income, tax cuts at the top — both for households in the top 1 percent and the top 5 percent – are more than triple the total value of the tax cuts received for people with incomes in the bottom 60 percent,"" the report said. So, yes, the tax cuts that Hovde has publicly supported and endorsed would benefit the rich more than middle-class workers. And it’s likely that those same cuts would raise the U.S. debt, too. A Hovde campaign spokesperson did not respond to multiple requests for comment. And Hovde’s campaign website doesn’t list any sort of tax plan, and he hasn’t spoken at length about a tax plan, either. Our ruling Baldwin claimed that Hovde ""supports a $4 trillion tax plan that would disproportionately advantage the well-off and profitable corporations."" Hovde has publicly supported extending the 2017 tax cuts Donald Trump put in place. Research has shown that those tax cuts are more likely to benefit the ultrarich, while the middle class receives less of a benefit. This proposal isn’t new in any way — it would simply continue the status quo. And although everyone benefited from those tax cuts, the wealthy saw the biggest savings when paying their taxes, instead of low and middle-class Americans. We rate this claim as Mostly True, meaning the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information."

Users there shared a video of 12 buses from Yankee Line, a charter bus company, leaving Harris’ Sept. 4 event and said it was proof that Harris was busing people to the rally from Massachusetts. The evidence that Bongino provided for his claim that the Harris’ campaign was busing people to the rally was the CBS reporter saying attendees were leaving the rally on shuttles. But the buses were used only to transport people to the rally from a parking lot a few miles away. A Yankee Line spokesperson told PolitiFact in an email that the company provided shuttle service buses from ""an offsite parking lot 3 miles away"" because of parking restrictions at the venue. The rally took place at Throwback Brewery in North Hampton, New Hampshire. We geolocated the business and confirmed that its parking lot would be too small to accommodate the thousands of people who were reported to have attended the event. We contacted Bongino for comment but did not immediately receive a response. PolitiFact has previously rated multiple claims False that the Harris’ campaign is paying attendees at its events. A Harris-Walz spokesperson told PolitiFact in August that their ""campaign does not pay people to attend rallies."" The claim was shared amid news that attendees at former President Donald Trump’s rally in California’s Coachella Valley were stranded for hours Oct. 12 after shuttles that had brought them to the venue from parking lots were delayed in taking them back to their vehicles. Although the Harris-Walz campaign provided buses to shuttle people from a nearby parking lot to the rally, the campaign did not bus people from out of state to the venue to increase attendance at the event, as Bongino and social media users claimed. We rate Bongino’s claim that CBS exposed ""the fact"" that Kamala Harris’ crowd sizes are inflated because her campaign bused hundreds of attendees to her New Hampshire rally Mostly False."
,MOSTLY FALSE,Byron Donalds,“Wages adjusted for inflation were massively up under Donald Trump for Black men. … The (Black-white) wage gap in 2019 was actually shrinking under Donald Trump's administration.”,,2024-10-13,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/15/byron-donalds/fact-checking-misleading-claims-about-black-wage-g/,,"In recent days, Democrats have fretted about polls showing soft support for Vice President Kamala Harris among Black voters, and especially among Black men — a development that some Democrats fear could imperil Harris’ chances to win in November. On Oct. 14, Harris released an ""Opportunity Agenda for Black Men"" that her campaign hoped would win more support. U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., an ally of former President Donald Trump, said there’s a reason members of this core Democratic group should vote for Trump instead. ""The big stat — and this happened during the first Trump administration — nobody likes to talk about it,"" Donalds said Oct. 13 on CNN’s ""State of the Union."" ""Wages adjusted for inflation were massively up under Donald Trump for Black men, for Black families, but for all Americans. The wage gap that Democrats love to lecture about — the wage gap in 2019 was actually shrinking under Donald Trump's administration, his economic policies, his energy policies, and his regulatory policies."" Wages for Black Americans and Black men did rise under Trump, but Donalds ignored that they rose three times faster under Trump’s successor, President Joe Biden, even after adjusting for a period of 40-year-high inflation on Biden’s watch. Rather than narrowing under Trump, the Black-white wage gap widened. Sign up for PolitiFact texts ""I can’t find any way that suggests that (Donalds) is right,"" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a center-right think tank. ""No economist is pointing to this."" Donalds’ office did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Inflation-adjusted wages for Black men rose under Trump, then faster under Biden First, let’s look at inflation-adjusted wages. We turned to the standard metric for inflation-adjusted wages, the median usual weekly inflation-adjusted earnings for full-time wage and salary workers, age 16 and older. To fact-check Donalds, we looked at this statistic broken down for Black Americans overall, Black men, white Americans overall and white men. This data goes back to 2000, so we will compare the full terms of presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Trump and Biden. To compare these presidencies, we reduced month-to-month volatility by averaging the quarterly figures for each president to produce an overall average for his term. To make the fairest comparison, we removed the data for the four quarters of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic’s peak period. During those quarters, federal stimulus checks spiked earnings for many workers, meaning that those months were outliers from the patterns before and after. What do the numbers show? For Black Americans overall, inflation-adjusted weekly earnings did rise under Trump. They increased from an average of about $275 under Obama to about $281 under Trump, an increase of roughly 2%. (The first six months of Obama’s presidency included the Great Recession, and much of his first term coincided with a sluggish recovery.) Under Biden, wages went up even higher. Inflation-adjusted weekly wages for Black Americans rose from $281 under Trump to $298 under Biden — an increase of about 6%. The rise was about three times faster under Biden than under Trump. The same pattern holds for Black men. For Black men, inflation-adjusted weekly earnings rose from an average of about $290 under Obama to about $295 under Trump, an increase of roughly 1.8%. Once again, wage growth was higher under Biden. Inflation-adjusted weekly wages for Black men rose from $295 under Trump to $312 under Biden, up 5.7%. The white-Black wage gap didn’t shrink under Trump; it widened How about the wage gap — the difference in wages between white and Black Americans, and between white and Black men? Using the same set of statistics, including the cordoning off of the pandemic period, we found the wage gap didn’t shrink, but widened under Trump. During Obama’s presidency, inflation-adjusted wages for Black Americans trailed the equivalent figure for white Americans by $74.5 on average. Under Trump, that average gap rose to $84.9. Under Biden, the gap narrowed to $74.40. The same pattern held for men. Under Obama, inflation-adjusted wages for Black men trailed the equivalent figure for white men by $96 on average. Under Trump, that average gap widened to $105.30. Under Biden, the gap narrowed to $92.80, smaller than under Obama. Why have wages for Black Americans, including Black men, risen faster under Biden? Some may have benefited from a more general trend among all races of lower-income Americans seeing unusually fast economic gains. With a low unemployment rate, workers have had greater leverage to get raises from their employers. Pandemic-era stimulus efforts, including Biden’s American Rescue Plan Act, ""had follow-on effects of giving workers more options and greater individual bargaining power, which led to higher real wages for those lower on the income scale and may be reflected in Black men's higher wages and salaries under Biden than Trump,"" said Calvin Schermerhorn, an Arizona State University historian who studies capitalism and African American inequality. Holtz-Eakin agreed with Schermerhorn that the wage gains for lower-income workers may account for the rise under Biden, though he added that similar gains were occurring in 2019 under Trump, when the unemployment rate was roughly as low and the labor market was similarly tight. However, that stopped in a year or so with the pandemic, whereas Biden has had several years for this phenomenon to occur, magnifying the gains. Our ruling Donalds said, ""Wages adjusted for inflation were massively up under Donald Trump for Black men. … The wage gap that Democrats love to lecture about — the wage gap in 2019 was actually shrinking under Donald Trump's administration."" For both Black Americans overall and for Black men in particular, inflation-adjusted wages rose under Trump — but they rose about three times faster under Biden. The white-Black wage gap, both overall and for men in particular, didn’t shrink under Trump. Rather, it widened, before narrowing under Biden. We rate the statement Mostly False."
,MOSTLY FALSE,Tammy Baldwin,Opponent Eric Hovde “opposes efforts to negotiate with the big pharmaceutical companies to lower the price of prescription drugs.”,,2024-10-18,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/31/tammy-baldwin/baldwin-falls-short-with-claim-on-hovdes-stance-on/,,"As the clock ticks toward Election Day 2024, candidate claims and counterclaims grow more pointed. In Wisconsin, the top statewide contest pits incumbent U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., against Republican challenger Eric Hovde. During an Oct. 18 debate that included health care costs, Baldwin took aim at Hovde over pricey prescription medications. ""He opposes efforts to negotiate with the big pharmaceutical companies to lower the price of prescription drugs, saving patients and Medicare money,"" Baldwin said. But Hovde shot back. ""I believe we need to negotiate with Big Pharma,"" said Hovde, who has multiple sclerosis. Hovde, as reported by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in May 1991. Sign up for PolitiFact texts ""I think our drug prices are too high. When I first started taking my medications for MS, they cost about $6,000 a year,"" Hovde said. ""Now they're costing $35,000 for generic drug prices. I'm against Big Pharma."" So, is Hovde on board with lowering prescription drug prices or not? A Hovde spokesman did not respond to an email request for comment. But let’s take a look at Baldwin’s claim. Opposes Inflation Reduction Act When asked to support Baldwin’s claim, a staff member pointed to several statements Hovde made opposing the Inflation Reduction Act, which, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, made improvements to Medicare by expanding benefits and lowering drug costs. ""For the first time, the law provides Medicare the ability to directly negotiate the prices of certain high expenditure, single source drugs without generic or biosimilar competition,"" the CMS.gov website says. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, among other provisions, included a three-year extension of Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies and capped out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs and insulin for Medicare Part D beneficiaries. The Biden administration said in August that, using the Inflation Reduction Act, it had negotiated with drugmakers to cut the cost of the 10 most expensive drugs under Medicare. But the bill also provided $369 billion in energy and climate change infrastructure. During an August 2022 radio interview on the ""Vicki McKenna Show,"" posted on listennotes.com, Hovde referred to the Inflation Reduction Act as a ""big, ugly bill."" When asked which federal programs he would cut if elected, Hovde, in an Oct. 1 radio interview with Joy Powers of WUWM’s ""Lake Effect,"" said he would cut federal spending to 2019 levels. Powers asked which programs Hovde would cut if he’s elected. ""All federal programs spending went up, but the bulk of the increase were on things like the Inflation Reduction Act, the Chips Act, which, you know, I don't know why we spent so much money for corporate welfare for big chip makers."" In an Oct. 8 op-ed Hovde penned and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel published, Hovde wrote: ""I will fight for increased price transparency throughout the health care system, empowering patients and employees to price shop and make informed decisions. I will fight to require health insurers … to disclose their negotiated drug rebates and discounts, revealing the true cost of prescription drugs."" So, basically, Hovde opposes the Inflation Reduction Act, a multifaceted bill that included a provision allowing negotiation of some Medicare drug prices for the first time. Noting that, Hovde also has explicitly stated ""I believe we need to negotiate with Big Pharma"" and ""I think our drug prices are too high."" Hovde, before the Oct. 18 debate, has also discussed what he would do to curtail costs from pharmaceutical companies. Our ruling Baldwin said ""(Hovde) opposes efforts to negotiate with the big pharmaceutical companies to lower the price of prescription drugs."" Hovde has opposed the Inflation Reduction Act, which has been used to negotiate lower drug prices with drugmakers. But there’s also a lot of other spending, unrelated to drug prices, in the law, which Hovde calls inflationary. Nevertheless, Hovde has made it clear he believes drug prices are too high and ""we need to negotiate with Big Pharma"" and to put pressure on drugmakers in other ways. For a statement that contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate this Mostly False."
,MOSTLY FALSE,Tim Moore,"“I’ve not gotten a single call from the White House [after Hurricane Helene hit North Carolina], but [Donald Trump] and his team have been in touch with us from Day 1.”",,2024-10-21,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/31/tim-moore/nc-house-speaker-falsely-says-white-house-didnt-ca/,,"North Carolina Rep. Tim Moore says former President Donald Trump has been more responsive than President Joe Biden’s administration since Hurricane Helene devastated western North Carolina. Helene on Sept. 27 caused record-setting flooding in western North Carolina, killing more than 100 people and displacing hundreds more. Since then, Trump, Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have each visited the region to survey the damage. During Trump’s Oct. 21 visit to Asheville, he invited Moore to the mic to speak about his experience. ""I’ve not gotten a single call from the White House, but this man and his team have been in touch with us from Day 1,"" said Moore, the speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives. His comments were shared on social media by The Blaze, a conservative media site with more than 1 million followers. PolitiFact has fact-checked several claims about lawmakers involved in Helene relief efforts — including Moore. When we looked into Moore’s statement about his communication with the Biden administration, we found the White House tried contacting Moore at least three times by phone or email and spoke with his staff, but Moore never personally responded. Sign up for PolitiFact texts On Sept. 30 and Oct. 4, a White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs staff member emailed Moore’s legislative email account, White House records show. ""Hi Speaker Moore and team, Hope you are doing well! … I’m emailing to check in on you and your constituents following Hurricane Helene,"" the White House staffer said Sept. 30, the third day after the storm hit. ""If you hear from any members of your caucus who are looking for federal resources, please don’t hesitate to send along my contact information. If there is ever anything I can do for you, please let me know."" The White House staffer’s Oct. 4 email to Moore referred to a phone call on Oct. 2, the White House said. ""Thanks for chatting on the phone earlier this week! Please let me know if there is anything I can do to support you all. I’m available by phone or email,"" the Oct. 4 email said. In an Oct. 24 interview with PolitiFact, Moore said he was unaware that the White House staffer had called and emailed his office. That’s because he was traveling through western North Carolina surveying damage and because the White House staff member spoke with a member of Moore’s staff — not Moore himself — a detail the White House confirmed. ""I didn't realize I had gotten it,"" Moore said during an interview at the state legislative building. ""It came to our email and our scheduler had a brief conversation with whoever that staffer was."" Moore also declined to provide evidence for his claim that Trump had been in contact ""from Day 1"" of the storm, nor did he share any other details about the communication. The Trump campaign didn’t respond to requests for comment. In an interview, Moore said the point of his comments was not about who called him or when. The point, he said, was to praise Trump and members of his team for keeping regular contact with him after Helene hit — and to express his frustration with what he described as a slow government response to storm victims who still needed help on the ground. Moore said Trump, former U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley each called him in the days after Helene hit. Gabbard visited Moore’s district and brought generators, chainsaws and other supplies, he said. Meanwhile, Moore said he was upset to learn from victims that their needs weren’t being met. ""There has been a lot of extra calls that we've had to make that we shouldn't have had to make,"" Moore said. ""As we were there (in the disaster area), I would get grabbed by somebody saying, ‘We've not heard from anybody on this’ and wanting to know an answer."" North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper’s office issued an update on response and recovery efforts Oct. 21, the same day Moore made his comments criticizing the White House response. In a media release, Cooper’s office said crews had restored electricity to all but 5,000 customers in the disaster area. It said most of the storm-affected cellphone coverage had been restored, and that road crews had opened 789 of the 1,200 roads that had been closed as a result of the storm. Although public schools in 28 storm-affected districts had reopened, seven remained closed. Because road access remained limited, Cooper’s office said the state and federal governments worked with volunteers and nonprofit groups to deliver water, food and medicine to some areas. By Oct. 21, the Federal Emergency Management Agency had paid $129 million to people affected by Helene. More than 207,000 people had registered for individual financial assistance, and people had filed more than 5,100 registrations for Small Business Administration loans. Cooper’s office added that recovery in the more mountainous areas would ""require a unique, united and sustained effort that focuses on people who’ve lost everything while leaving politics at the door."" Moore said that although the White House deserves scrutiny for its funding priorities, he’s tried to avoid bringing politics into the disaster response. Moore said he also wants to give credit where it’s due. ""The folks on the ground from FEMA who are working? They are hardworking people who are trying to help folks here,"" Moore said. Our ruling Moore said, ""I’ve not gotten a single call from the White House."" White House records showed a Biden administration staffer called Moore’s office at least once and emailed Moore twice, writing, ""Please let me know if there is anything I can do to support you all."" A White House staff member spoke with one of Moore’s staffers, not directly with Moore. Moore said he had been unaware of the communication. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression of the White House outreach. We rate it Mostly False."
,TRUE,Kamala Harris,"""As of today, we have cut the flow of immigration by over half.""",,2024-10-23,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/24/kamala-harris/kamala-harris-correct-that-immigration-at-the-us-s/,,"Immigration has been one of the toughest issues for Vice President Kamala Harris to address on the campaign trail; her opponent, Donald Trump, has repeatedly spotlighted a spike of illegal immigration under her and President Joe Biden. But in a recent CNN town hall in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, Harris offered an optimistic data point. ""As of today, we have cut the flow of immigration by over half,"" Harris told moderator Anderson Cooper Oct. 23. She’s right. Depending on when you start counting, the drop is well over half. The night of the town hall, Harris’ campaign pointed PolitiFact to official federal government data on encounters at the United States’ southwestern border with Mexico. Sign up for PolitiFact texts Encounters are occasions when immigration officials stop someone at the border. A single person could be stopped more than once and counted more than once, and encounters do not mean that the person is let into the U.S. But for understanding migration at the U.S. border, encounters are a standard metric. Border Patrol encounters with migrants between ports of entry at the southwest land border peaked in December 2023 at about 250,000. In September, the latest month with available data and the end of fiscal year 2024, there were about 54,000 encounters. That’s a 78% drop, or more than half, U.S. Customs and Border Protection data shows. If you start with a different month, the drop is still significant. From September 2023 to September 2024, the number fell from about 219,000 to 54,000, a 75.3% decline. From January 2024 to September 2024, the number fell from about 124,200 to 54,000, a 56.5% drop. U.S. immigration experts said it’s difficult to isolate single causes for changes in border arrival counts, but a Biden executive action that limits immigrants’ ability to apply for asylum at the southwest border took effect in June and likely has had an effect. ""The Biden playbook rests on narrowing asylum eligibility for migrants who cross the border illegally, expanding the use of lawful migration pathways, and encouraging Mexico, Panama, Costa Rica, and other regional partners to increase their migration controls and enforcement,"" the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, wrote in a recent analysis. Taken together, the group added, ""these policies have ushered in a new era of migration management in response to unprecedented changes in flows over the last three and a half years. These efforts represent new and innovative approaches to managing migration, even as they are subject to litigation and change."" Mexican efforts to increase its enforcement, driven partly by U.S. pressure, have also helped decrease immigration, experts say. Biden and former Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador spoke multiple times beginning in late 2023 and released statements about joint efforts to curb immigration, fentanyl and firearms trafficking. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Secretary of State Antony Blinken also went to Mexico in December to meet with their Mexican counterparts. David Bier, immigration studies director at the libertarian Cato institute, told PolitiFact in June that it’s reasonable to attribute border encounter declines to actions by Mexico, with a caveat. ""Mexico is making unprecedented arrests,"" Bier said. ""I believe that it is unsustainable because, although Mexico is arresting them and sending them to southern Mexico, they are not deporting them to their home countries. This means that it is very likely they will ultimately find their way to the United States because they are still in Mexico, and there's not much for them to do there except keep trying to get to the U.S."" Whether the declines will continue is uncertain, because migrants and migrant smugglers ""have proven highly adaptable to changes in policy, process, operations and even infrastructure,"" Theresa Cardinal Brown, senior adviser for immigration and border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank, told PolitiFact in June. ""We have not seen sustained decreases in arrivals after policy changes in the past."" Our ruling Harris said, ""As of today, we have cut the flow of immigration by over half."" The size of the drop varies depending on what month you start counting from, but over roughly the past year, the number of encounters along the southwestern U.S. border has declined from 57% to 78%. We rate the statement True. PolitiFact Staff Writer Maria Ramirez Uribe contributed to this report."
,HALF TRUE,Make the Road Nevada,Republican Senate candidate Sam Brown “wants to cut Medicaid and Social Security.”,,2024-10-28,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/nov/01/make-the-road-nevada/nevada-political-action-committee-gets-some-right/,,"Republican Sam Brown, running against U.S. Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., in a competitive Senate race, is again facing attacks that claim he wants to cut federal programs. This time, Make the Road Nevada, a liberal political action committee, is thumping Brown, a retired U.S. Army captain, for wanting to cut Medicaid and Social Security. ""Jacky Rosen is fighting for Nevada — lowering healthcare costs and expanding affordable housing,"" the group said in an Oct. 28 X post. ""Meanwhile, Sam Brown wants to cut Medicaid and Social Security. Nevada needs a leader who protects our future!"" We’ve checked a similar claim Rosen lobbed against Brown, saying he supported ""massive cuts"" to Social Security and Medicare. We rated that claim Mostly False. But what about cuts to Medicaid? Sign up for PolitiFact texts Although the Rosen campaign’s claims about Social Security and Medicare skewed Brown’s positions, there’s a bit more truth to the Make the Road Nevada’s Medicaid assertion, mostly because Brown has supported a balanced budget amendment. Make the Road Nevada spokesperson Jose Rivera said in an email to PolitiFact his team was focused on get-out-the-vote efforts and he did not think he could make PolitiFact's Nov. 1 deadline to provide more information. Brown’s campaign did not respond to an email seeking comment. He said in a statement to the Nevada Current, a nonprofit news site, for a May 17 article, ""I will not cut Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid."" The claim against Brown is well-documented, including an opposition research file on Brown’s positions posted by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Senate Democrats’ main political action committee. The publicly posted file includes identical excerpts to information Rosen’s campaign provided for the Medicare and Social Security fact-check. The research file points to Brown’s support for a balanced budget amendment, which economists say would lead to steep cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. The file also points to prior comments he made about wanting to eliminate federal agencies that have a duplicate state agency. In February, Brown backed a 2018 plan from Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., that called for a 1% cut to federal spending across the board to balance the budget, according to a July 2024 article from the Nevada Current. Although Paul described the mix of cuts and spending freezes as minimal — around $13 billion — the Washington Post Fact Checker found that description misleading, noting Paul’s proposed cuts totaled trillions of dollars when accounting for increased participation in Social Security and Medicare as baby boomers retire, increased population and inflation. Brown told the Current he supported a balanced budget amendment and thought Paul’s proposal was ""a very reasonable place to start."" Then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., promised a vote on a bill in 2023 balancing the budget within 10 years. McCarthy said he did not want cuts to defense, Social Security and Medicare. An analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan budget-focused think tank, found balancing the budget by 2032 would require cutting 25% of federal spending. Excluding Social Security and Medicare for cuts would necessitate cutting 85% of the remaining budget. To achieve that, the federal government would need to cut Medicaid in half and end all other mandatory spending or eliminate Medicaid entirely. Moving Medicaid management to states Brown also proposed a plan during a May 9, 2022, Republican Senate primary debate to eliminate federal agencies that had a similar state agency. The Nevada Department of Health and Human Services oversees Medicaid in the state, making it a similar agency to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. ""So, I have a twofold plan here,"" Brown said. ""One is start reducing the allocation of money to those federal departments and agencies and that will start cutting down our federal budget. And it also returns more control and power back to the states where we already have, for example a Department of Transportation, a Department of Education, a Department of Energy, environmental departments or agencies. At the end of the day, we reduce federal spending, but we also return power back to the states."" The moderator asked Brown specifically about Medicaid, and Brown answered, ""A lot of that is mandatory spending right now. We can start with what I just described."" Brown did not respond when the Nevada Current pressed him for specifics on how a state-run Medicaid program would work, saying he would not cut Medicaid. Medicaid paid Nevada more than $8 billion over fiscal years 2022 and 2023 for services. Brown complimented, but did not endorse, Scott’s sunsetting proposal The opposition research file cites Brown’s comments on a 2022 proposal by Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., that included automatically sunsetting federal legislation after five years, including Social Security and Medicaid, as an alternative agenda to that of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Democrats have sometimes exaggerated Republican support for Scott’s manifesto, though taken literally, the plan would sunset Medicaid unless it was specifically renewed. Scott eventually revised the plan in February 2023 to include a note saying his call to sunset federal legislation was never intended to apply to Social Security or Medicare, though did not specifically mention Medicaid. Brown, speaking to the Spring Mountain Republican Women in Las Vegas two days after Scott released his plan, was captured on a recording saying he admired Scott for producing the plan. ""I think I appreciate that he is trying to look forward, he is trying to cast a positive vision,"" Brown said. ""One of the things, I think, that some of the Republican Party leaders have failed at is we have become labeled — and sometimes we do this to ourselves — is we become the party of 'No. Oh, no, we're not going to do that.’ We're the party of just rejecting policy instead of the party of projecting ideas. What Rick Scott has done, attempting to create a roadmap for a better America, is something that I admire as well."" Brown never mentioned specifics or outright endorsed Scott’s plan in the recording. Our ruling Make the Road Nevada said, ""Sam Brown wants to cut Medicaid and Social Security."" Make the Road Nevada’s claim exaggerates Brown’s support for cutting Social Security. A Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee opposition research file, which has been the foundation for other attacks on Brown, based much of this on Brown supporting Scott’s plan, which called for sunsetting federal legislation every five years. Brown never said he supported Scott’s plan, only that he admired Scott’s trying to articulate a vision for the Republican Party. However, there is more truth to Make the Road Nevada’s claim about Medicaid. Brown supported across-the-board cuts to federal agencies through a balanced budget amendment. Balancing the federal budget is not as simple as Brown makes it sound. Brown has said he will not cut Medicaid, but declined to specify a balanced budget amendment that would preserve Social Security and Medicare without cutting Medicaid. Federal budget analysts said to ensure no cuts to Social Security and Medicare — as Brown said he wants — Medicaid would need to be cut either in half or entirely. We rate the claim Half True."

The social media posts exaggerate the details of what happened and make it sound as if Griswold personally or maliciously leaked information that endangered the election process. That’s not what happened. And Griswold didn’t file the lawsuit that sought to remove former President Donald Trump from Colorado’s primary ballot in 2023; she was a defendant in the case. Griswold told Colorado Public Radio on Oct. 30 that an employee who no longer works for the department accidentally posted a spreadsheet on the Colorado secretary of state’s website that contained a tab with passwords to Colorado’s voting machines. She added that secretaries of state do not have access to voting machine passwords. Sign up for PolitiFact texts The passwords were taken down Oct. 24 after being publicly available for several months, Griswold told KUSA-TV, a Denver-based NBC affiliate. Each voting machine requires two passwords, and the spreadsheet contained one of the two, Griswald said. A team is updating the compromised passwords, Axios reported. Besides the two passwords, the voting machines require security clearance to access. Libs of TikTok, which PolitiFact has previously fact-checked, said Griswold is ""the same person who tried to remove Trump from the ballot."" That’s also not right. In September 2023, six Colorado voters sued Griswold and demanded that she remove Trump from Colorado’s presidential primary ballot for his attempts to overthrow the 2020 election results. The voters cited the 14th Amendment’s insurrectionist clause as grounds for their lawsuit. Griswold ""was a defendant in this lawsuit, and did nothing to initiate it,"" Jack Todd, a secretary of state’s office spokesperson, told PolitiFact. The Colorado Supreme Court, siding with the plaintiffs, decided Trump should be removed from the state’s primary ballot for his involvement in the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, but the U.S. Supreme Court later overruled that decision. Griswold did not take a position on the lawsuit before the state court’s ruling, saying the decision on whether Trump would be disqualified ""has to be decided by a court, not the public opinion of the nation."" When the case went to the U.S. Supreme Court, Griswold said Trump should be kept off Colorado’s ballot. ""Colorado should be able to bar oath-breaking insurrections from our ballot,"" Griswold posted on X, saying she was ""disappointed"" by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision. Our ruling The Libs of TikTok X post said, ""The lady who leaked passwords for voting systems in Colorado is the same person who tried to remove Trump from the ballot."" Griswold did not personally leak Colorado’s voting machine passwords. Some were compromised after an employee, who no longer works for the department, accidentally posted a spreadsheet with a tab containing the passwords online. Separately, Griswold was a defendant in the lawsuit to remove Trump from Colorado’s presidential primary ballot last year, and did not initiate the effort. She supported it when it was challenged in the U.S. Supreme Court. The statement contains an element of truth — someone in Griswold’s office accidentally posted partial voting machines passwords online — but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

They say billionaire Elon Musk’s Starlink technology manipulated votes to benefit President-elect Donald Trump. Starlink is an internet provider that uses satellites to provide connectivity; it’s a subsidiary of Musk’s commercial spaceflight company SpaceX. ""Musk’s Starlink uploaded votes in swing states,"" one Nov. 10 Threads post said. ""Swing state voters went Dem downballot but Trump at the top? Unlikely. Starlink satellites exploding, destroying evidence."" Starlink made headlines in recent weeks when the company distributed equipment to help people regain internet access in hurricane-hit areas.

(Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.) Election security experts and state and local election officials rebutted the claims, saying the 2024 presidential election was secure and there’s no evidence of Starlink-related fraud. ""Starlink is suspected by conspiracy theorists not because of what it does, but because Elon Musk owns it,"" Mike Rothschild, a journalist, author and conspiracy theory expert, said. This conspiracy theory circulated on Threads amid a larger wave of election denial claims from liberals that mimic Republicans’ false claims about 2020 election fraud. ""Conspiracy theories about lost elections being stolen are a natural way to cope with an unexpected outcome,"" Rothschild said, adding that it’s important to ""leave conspiracism behind and embrace reality."" Election infrastructure is secure Jen Easterly, director of the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, reported Nov. 6 that the agency had ""no evidence of any malicious activity that had a material impact on the security or integrity of our election infrastructure."" Officials from swing states that received Starlink technology after the September and October hurricanes also said Starlink technology could not have been used to benefit Trump. North Carolina’s tabulators and ballot-marking devices are never connected to the internet, Patrick Gannon, the North Carolina State Board of Elections spokesperson, said. State law prohibits connecting such equipment to the internet, he said. ""Satellite-based internet devices were not used to tabulate or upload vote counts in North Carolina,"" Gannon said. ""In addition, our tabulated results are encrypted from source to destination preventing results being modified in transit. We have no evidence of any alteration of votes by anyone."" The other six swing states — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — have similar election security protocols to ensure voting equipment is never connected to the internet during ballot tabulation. Even if Starlink had somehow been used to modify the vote count, there are systems designed to catch tabulation discrepancies, including risk-limiting audits, canvassing and certification of the election results, said Michael Specter, a Georgia Institute of Technology assistant professor specializing in election security. ""None of these are foolproof, but each makes it significantly less likely that an attack would be successful,"" Specter said. Broadly speaking, voting machines are not connected to the internet, experts said. In some states, ballot tabulators are briefly connected to the internet to transmit results when polls close. And in many places, other election infrastructure, such as pollbooks with lists of digital voter registration records, have internet connectivity. We found little evidence Starlink is widely used during elections. Even in Asheville, North Carolina’s Buncombe County, one of the places hardest hit by Hurricane Helene, election officials told PolitiFact that Starlink was not used for any election functions. Genya Coulter, senior election analyst for the OSET Institute, a nonprofit group focused on accurate, secure and transparent elections, said she knew Starlink technology had been used to support election infrastructure in one place: Tulare County, California. Trump won Tulare County with about 60% of the vote. ""Most of the rural part of the county has little to no access to broadband, and Starlink was used to have the electronic pollbooks connected to a county voter database,"" Coulter said. Pollbooks are lists of digital voter registration records. Vote tabulators weren’t connected to Starlink satellite internet, she said, adding that the county had about 28,000 in-person voters. Regarding claims about Russian hackers swaying election outcomes, Coulter said she was ""less worried about Russian hackers affecting vote totals and significantly more concerned"" with the deluge of incorrect election information that Russian-linked groups distributed online before the election and the bomb threats targeting election infrastructure that officials said were ""of Russian origin."" What about reports of a Starlink satellite fireball? On Nov. 10, a Starlink satellite reentered Earth’s atmosphere heading southeast from Washington to Texas and exploded. Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist and science data system group leader at NASA’s Chandra X-ray Center, said there’s nothing noteworthy about that. ""This is not a case of suddenly deciding to retire this satellite within the past week,"" McDowell said. ""Such reentries have been happening almost daily for the past few years, they just are at random times and random places in the world so not often over the U.S. at night where Americans can see it."" According to U.S. Space Force data, SpaceX removed this particular satellite from operation Aug. 2, at which point the satellite started lowering its orbit, McDowell said. SpaceX abandoned the satellite Oct. 13, McDowell said. Stargazers in the southwest United States reported seeing fireballs in the early morning hours Nov. 10. McDowell said that’s normal: During satellite reentry and breakup, observers can sometimes see fireballs moving slowly across the sky. Why Democrats won Senate races while Trump won presidency Some of the posts that floated the Starlink conspiracy theory pointed to Democratic successes in some down-ballot races as evidence that something was off in the Trump-Harris results. Although there’s a strong correlation between votes cast for president and senator, it’s not ironclad. Voters are free to choose candidates from different parties for different offices, and some fraction of voters do. Ticket-splitting — when voters choose a Democrat for one office and a Republican for another — has become less common in recent election cycles as political polarization has increased. But the practice hasn’t disappeared entirely. Incumbency can help candidates win reelection. For instance, two swing states had Democratic incumbents keep their Senate seats: Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin and Jacky Rosen in Nevada. Their achievements in office and voters’ familiarity might have helped these candidates. Controversy, or a lack thereof, can also affect candidates’ campaigns. In Arizona, for example, Republican Kari Lake came to voters’ attention in 2022 when she lost a gubernatorial race built heavily on claims that elections are fraudulent, including the 2020 presidential race that Biden won. This year, she lost to Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, a retired U.S. Marine and a Latino, in a campaign year in which Latino voters were pivotal within the electorate. Specter said split-ticket voting ""does not provide sufficient evidence that any malfeasance has occurred."" Our ruling Threads posts said Musk’s Starlink technology manipulated votes in the 2024 election to benefit Trump. Federal and state election officials rebutted claims of 2024 election fraud, including claims that Starlink manipulated the vote counts. Voting machines aren’t typically connected to the internet, and long-standing systems ensure votes are fairly and accurately tabulated. We found only one instance — in California, not a swing state — of Starlink technology being used to support election infrastructure, such as having the electronic pollbooks connected to a county voter database.

Hochul returned to her Buffalo roots when she recently cited steady job growth on her watch. ""I grew up in a tough neighborhood,"" Hochul told business leaders at an event hosted by the Partnership for New York City and Crain’s New York Business. ""You know, I've come from the streets of Buffalo and Lackawanna Steel Plant, and Dad worked in a steel plant. My parents lived in a trailer park. So, I've seen how tough it is out there. I know what people are going through, because people that my parents lived next door to still live in that same trailer park years later, the families. People have not escaped, and my job is to help them by creating more jobs with all of you. We've created 732,000 jobs since I've been governor."" Is Hochul right? Have 732,000 jobs have been created since she became governor in late summer 2021? Hochul’s staff told us they determined that 732,000 new jobs have been created by comparing private sector job data, which is seasonally adjusted, from August 2021, the month that Hochul was sworn in, with data from July 2024. In August 2021, there were 7,669,100 private sector jobs in New York state. In July 2024, there were 8,401,500 jobs. That's a difference of 732,400 jobs. These figures are available from the state Labor Department and are collected through a survey of payrolls in cooperation with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Hochul’s staff told PolitiFact the July data she relied upon to make her claim was ""current at the time of the event."" But Hochul spoke Nov. 19, and datasets from August, September and October were available. When asked about the newer data, the governor’s staff said that her figure represents a picture of the governor’s first full three years in office. Sign up for PolitiFact texts Seasonally adjusted data shows that private sector jobs have fallen consistently, if modestly, since July. In August, the number of jobs fell by 8,100 from July. In September, the number of jobs fell again by 2,900. And in October, they fell by 800. The October data was released five days before Hochul’s statement. Comparing the data from the month when she took office, August 2021, with the most recent data available, preliminary data from October 2024, when private sector jobs totaled 8,391,200, the result is an increase of 722,100 jobs, or nearly 10,000 fewer than she claimed. Although that is a lower figure, the difference represents 0.1% of the state’s private sector employment. That could be covered by the data’s margin of error. The survey data for the Current Employment Statistics program counts people who are employed during any part of their pay period on the 12th of every month, and this data set reflects the most up-to-date information when Hochul took office Aug. 24, 2021. The data does not include independent contractors. Another way to look at the job figures is to take all of the nonfarm jobs, not just private sector jobs. (Farm jobs are not counted in this data set because their numbers can be volatile, depending on the weather and other factors.) From August 2021 to October 2024, nonfarm jobs, seasonally adjusted, increased by 784,500. (In October there were 9,871,100 jobs and in August 2021 there were 9,086,600.) Seasonally adjusted data can typically provide a better comparison between different months from different years, Bureau of Labor Statistics economist Bruce Bergman said. A governor has debatable influence over the economy and job creation, especially after a global pandemic. Hochul took office as New York and the nation were recovering from deep job losses because of the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and growth was trending upward. ""You’ll see that big upswing in the data,"" said Scott Laing, clinical assistant professor of finance at the School of Management at the University at Buffalo. The month-to-month changes are flatter now, he said. New York ranks 11th among states in job growth from August 2021 to September 2024, according to Laing’s analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Nevada and Texas topped the list. Hochul prefaced her remarks by talking about a troubled economy in western New York, but the recovery between July 2019 and July 2024 happened downstate, according to an analysis of nonseasonally adjusted data by E.J. McMahon, an adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute and a longtime conservative observer of state economics. ""All of the state’s job recovery, and then some, has been concentrated in New York City,"" McMahon said. ""And upstate, as of July, still had not recovered to its July 2019 level."" Our ruling Hochul ignored the latest monthly jobs reports when she said 732,000 jobs had been created during her administration. Accounting for the three more recent reports shows a slightly smaller increase of 722,000 jobs. But that difference is minimal given the total number of private sector jobs, and falls within the data’s margin of error. When counting all nonfarm jobs — not just private sector jobs — the job growth exceeded her statement, with 784,500 new jobs between August 2021 and October 2024. The governor’s claim about job growth is mostly accurate. We rate it Mostly True."

,TRUE,Jay Rothman,"“The Universities of Wisconsin are 43rd out of 50 states in the nation, in terms of public support for our universities. The $855 million (budget request) gets us up to average.”",,2024-12-01,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/dec/12/jay-rothman/would-the-uw-systems-855-million-budget-request-br/,,"State funding for the University of Wisconsin System was one of the biggest budget battles in 2023, and it’s looking as if 2025 will be no different. The UW System is asking for $855 million from the state Legislature in the upcoming two-year state budget, which lawmakers will craft in the coming months. In November, Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said Republicans, who control the Legislature, would not give that large of an amount to the system. ""That’s probably not going to happen,"" Vos told WISN-TV’s ""Upfront."" Appearing Dec. 1 on ""Upfront,"" UW System President Jay Rothman was asked to respond to Vos saying the system was ""(asking) for the moon"" and ""unrealistic."" ""I look at it from this perspective,"" Rothman said. ""Right now, the Universities of Wisconsin are 43rd out of 50 states in the nation, in terms of public support for our universities. The $855 million gets us up to average."" Sign up for PolitiFact texts Rothman said that amount will help universities keep tuition at current levels and keep remaining branch campuses open. ""That’s a reasonable ask,"" he said. Let’s examine Rothman’s claim in two parts. First, does Wisconsin rank 43rd in funding for its public university system? And second, would that $855 million bring Wisconsin closer to the middle of the pack? Does Wisconsin rank 43rd in public higher education funding? PolitiFact Wisconsin contacted the UW System to ask where Rothman got his numbers. Media Relations Director Mark Pitsch pointed us to the State Higher Education Finance report. The national report, produced by the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association, accounts for fiscal year 2023. A chart in the report shows total education revenue per full-time equivalent student — a number that represents tuition dollars plus state support. That’s how the association defines ""public funding."" The UW System operated under a tuition freeze, as required by the state, for 10 years, Pitsch noted. Wisconsin did land at 43rd in that chart. Only Nevada, Louisiana, West Virginia, New Hampshire, Florida, California and Arkansas provided less per student. Another report from the Wisconsin Policy Forum, released in spring 2023, cited the same, 43rd ranking. PolitiFact Wisconsin reported on this data before, when we checked Democrats’ claims that Republicans were to blame for that low ranking. So, the first part of Rothman’s argument is right. Wisconsin does rank 43rd, providing less funding for public, four-year colleges than most other states. Would the UW System’s $855 million budget request bring the state closer to average? Now, let’s get into the second part of Rothman’s argument: That the UW System’s budget request would bring Wisconsin toward the middle. Pitsch laid out the UW System’s math for us. Of the $855 million the system is asking for, $398 million of that would come in the first year of the two-year budget, and $457 million would come in the second. The system was ""intentional"" in requesting that $457 million in the second year, Pitsch said, ""as a conservative way of getting ‘up to the middle.’"" That same chart in the state-by-state report that we looked at before — total education revenue per student — says that number is $17,031 in Wisconsin. The middle of the chart shows the national average, which is $20,373. The difference between those two numbers is $3,342 per student, Pitsch said. Multiplying that number by the total enrollment in the system in 2023 — 136,641 students — gets you $456.65 million. Rounding up, that’s the $457 million the system wants in the second year. So, Rothman is correct that the system’s request for the second year would bring Wisconsin up to average. Of course, that’s assuming the difference gets made up entirely through funding from the state, rather than through tuition increases. Rothman has said he doesn’t plan to recommend tuition hikes over the next two years. Rothman said the $855 million ""gets us up to average"" on ""Upfront,"" but elsewhere he’s made clear that an additional $457 million annually — the phased in request for the second year — is what would help Wisconsin get there. The system is actually asking for less than that — $398 million — in the first of the two years. Although that may need a little clarification, the heart of Rothman’s claim, and the system’s math, checks out. Our ruling Rothman defended his agency’s $855 million budget request by saying it ""gets (Wisconsin) up to average"" and steps up from its low ranking. He is correct that Wisconsin ranks 43rd in the country when it comes to funding public, four-year universities. Rothman’s math also adds up. Subtracting Wisconsin’s revenue per student from the national average, then multiplying it by the total number of students in the system, does total $457 million. The UW System said asking for that number in the second year of the budget was deliberate on their part, and the system is actually asking for $59 million less than that in the first year. We rate Rothman’s claim True."

Does the bill really take money away from western North Carolina? The law ends the governor’s ability to boost unemployment benefits amid a state emergency, something Cooper did after Helene. That could mean that North Carolinians won’t receive higher benefits in the future. But the law doesn’t include a provision that would withdraw any money that has already been allocated to people in the western part of the state. When Cooper made this statement, the bill had not yet become law, so his use of the past tense may have confused some North Carolinians. It’s also worth noting that unemployment aid is far from the only way the state has been helping Helene victims. Beyond the immediate response that included hundreds of state and federal workers on the ground, the Republican-led state legislature has also approved more than $1 billion in Helene aid relief. That’s a fraction of the nearly $4 billion in aid Cooper called for while governor, though state lawmakers say they plan to do more in the future. The power in question Helene hit North Carolina on Sept. 27, bringing 30 inches of rain, causing more than 1,400 landslides. It was the deadliest and most damaging in state history. According to an estimate by the state’s budget director, Helene damaged about 74,000 western North Carolina homes — only about 5% of which were covered by flood insurance. On Oct. 16, Cooper issued an executive order that raised the maximum weekly unemployment benefit from $350 per week to $600 per week and extended eligibility from 12 weeks to 26 weeks for Helene victims. Cooper cited powers granted to him under the state's Emergency Management Act when announcing the order. The increased amount was available to anyone seeking unemployment benefits in North Carolina — not just Helene victims. Unemployment benefit payouts increased by more than 10,000 cases after Helene hit North Carolina, according to data provided by the state commerce department. In August, 19,271 people received benefits. The number dipped to 17,981 in September, then shot up to 27,385 in October and rose to 31,547 by the end of the year. Republican leaders don’t believe the Emergency Management Act authorizes the governor to boost unemployment benefits, so they included a section in Senate Bill 382 to ""correct a misapprehension of the powers conferred to the governor,"" the bill states. It also says the law ""does not allow for the governor to waive, modify, suspend, or fail to enforce or execute"" the laws related to employment security. Cooper’s claim that Republicans ""took"" money out of western North Carolina could give the impression that money going to Helene victims, or that was scheduled to go to Helene victims, is being revoked. But that’s not so. Delayed effect of the bill The bill says the enhanced employment security benefits won’t end until March 1, when North Carolina’s state of emergency is scheduled to expire. ""This does not take money from Western North Carolina and does not impact a single dollar of unemployment benefits currently flowing to employees in that area,"" Lauren Horsch, a spokesperson for Republican Senate leader Phil Berger, told PolitiFact in a statement. Cooper’s office didn’t dispute that the bill leaves the current unemployment benefits untouched, but argued that Helene victims will likely still need the enhanced benefits after March 1, so withdrawing the governor’s ability to increase those payments will have significant consequences for people struggling to rebuild. Gov. Josh Stein, also a Democrat, is expected to extend the state of emergency beyond March 1, Cooper’s office said last month, before Stein was sworn in. States of emergency for less-devastating hurricanes lasted longer than six months. For example, North Carolina was under a state of emergency for 15 months following 2018’s Hurricane Florence. ""Because Republican legislators are shortchanging western North Carolina recovery, especially the small business grants that are desperately needed to support the economy, residents out west will need enhanced unemployment benefits beyond next March,"" Cooper spokesperson Ben Conroy said. ""The Legislature's shameful decision to rip this power away from future governors only harms North Carolinians who need support to recover from this and future natural disasters,"" Conroy said. Laura Brewer, a Stein spokesperson, told PolitiFact that the new governor hasn’t decided whether to extend the state of emergency, adding that there are many options ""to help them rebuild and recover, including support for those who have lost their jobs, homes, and businesses."" Our ruling Cooper said North Carolina Republicans ""took money out of western North Carolina"" when they passed a Hurricane Helene relief bill last month. Legislators stripped the governor’s power to enhance unemployment benefits using the state’s Emergency Management Act. Cooper has a point in that if the state of emergency is extended without the bill in place, unemployed Helene victims could continue to receive enhanced benefits beyond March 1. But the bill did not claw back or halt enhanced unemployment benefits that are scheduled to be available through March 1. We rate his claim Half True."
,FALSE,Mike Johnson,About 1% of federal employees are “actually working in the office.”,,2024-12-05,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/dec/11/mike-johnson/mike-johnsons-pants-on-fire-claim-that-1-of-federa/,,"As high-profile businesspeople Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy launched their Department of Government Efficiency — part of President-elect Donald Trump’s efforts to slash government spending — House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., cast the federal workforce as avoiding its duties. ""Well, there was a report that came out today, I don't know if you all have seen it, but someone did a little survey about how many federal employees are actually working in the office,"" Johnson told reporters Dec. 5. ""By one estimate, it may be about 1%, if you don't count the security personnel that are covering these buildings. … And, so, one of the first things that I think you'll see is a demand from the new administration, and from all of us in Congress, that federal workers return to their desks and get back to the work that they are supposed to be doing."" Johnson’s office did not respond to our inquiries. But his comments followed the Dec. 5 release of a report by Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, that criticized federal employees' working practices; it was titled, ""Out of office: Bureaucrats on the beach and in bubble baths but not in office buildings."" The report said 6% of federal workers ""report in-person on a full-time basis, while nearly one-third are entirely remote."" On the day of Johnson’s remarks, Musk posted on X to spotlight the New York Post’s coverage of Ernst’s report. In his post, Musk said, ""If you exclude security guards & maintenance personnel, the number of government workers who show up in person and do 40 hours of work a week is closer to 1%!"" This 1% figure does not appear in Ernst’s report. Sign up for PolitiFact texts Ernst’s office also did not respond to inquiries. But her report drew from a survey by a news outlet that later clarified it was not a scientific survey and should not be used to draw conclusions about the federal workforce. Surveys by federal agencies have found vastly different figures. For example, the federal Office of Personnel Management, which handles the federal government’s human resources, found that about 14% of federal employees work remotely full time. That study also found that 32% of federal workers never work remotely, meaning they work in the office five days a week. Another study, by the federal Office of Management and Budget, which helps craft presidential budget proposals and manage the executive branch, found that half of federal workers aren’t eligible to work remotely. Employees eligible for remote work average three days a week in the office, the study found. What Ernst’s report drew from The federal government employs more than 4 million people, including 2.28 million federal civilian employees. Ernst’s report relies on government, media and whistleblower reports; her office did not undertake its own statistical research. Its headline finding — that 6% of federal workers report in-person on a full-time basis — cites a survey released in April by the Federal News Network, a news outlet covering the federal workforce. The survey gauged current federal employees’ perspectives on post-COVID-19 return-to-office changes at their agencies. It received 6,338 responses, which represents 0.2% to 0.3% of the total federal workforce. About 30% of respondents said they work entirely remotely, 6% said they work entirely in-person and 64% said they work a hybrid of in-office and remote. However, on Dec. 6, one day after Ernst released her report citing the survey, Federal News Network appended an editor’s note to its report, clarifying that the survey was ""non-scientific."" Federal News Network noted that respondents chose whether to participate in the survey, a process that survey experts say can create bias. Federal News Network Executive Editor Jason Miller told PolitiFact that the survey system didn’t prevent one person from answering the survey more than once. ""As we said in our story, the 6% number is a snapshot of federal employees who responded to our online survey,"" Miller said. ""We don’t believe, nor have ever said, this data represents all federal employees."" Other surveys show far different rates of telework Other federal workforce surveys contradict the Federal News Network’s findings. The 2023 edition of an annual survey by the Office of Personnel Management asked federal workers about their telework practices. Invitations were sent to more than 1.6 million employees, of whom more than 625,568, or 39%, responded. About 46% said they rarely or never work remotely. Another 17% said they worked remotely one or two days a week. Fourteen percent said they were full-time remote workers. The agency’s 2024 survey, which was released after Johnson’s remarks, did not ask telework questions. The Office of Management and Budget released another study on the federal workforce in August. It found that, as of May, about half of federal workers held jobs that did not allow for telework, such as positions that provide health care to veterans, inspect the food supply and manage federal natural lands. ""At the same time, telework-eligible personnel spent approximately 60% of regular, working hours in-person at agency-assigned job sites,"" the report said, indicating federal workforce telework rates generally in line with the private sector, according to Congressional Budget Office data. Ernst’s report cited the Office of Personnel Management and Office of Management and Budget reports. But it did not cite the overall telework data that conflicted with the Federal News Network survey. The American Federation of Government Employees, a federal workforce labor union, criticized Ernst’s report and what it described as ""misstatements"" by lawmakers and members of Trump’s transition team. ""Exaggerating the number of federal employees who telework and portraying those who do as failing to show up for work is a deliberate attempt to demean the federal workforce and justify the wholesale privatization of public-sector jobs,"" the union said in a Dec. 6 statement. Our ruling Johnson said about 1% of federal employees are ""actually working in the office."" He appeared to be citing Ernst’s report, which relied on a Federal News Network survey that produced a low figure of in-office employees but is not comprehensive. The outlet said the survey was not scientific and should not be used to draw conclusions about federal employees. Conversely, the Office of Personnel Management found in 2023 that about 14% of federal employees work remotely full time, and that 32% of federal workers never work remotely. The Office of Management and Budget found that half of federal workers aren’t eligible to work remotely, and that the half who are average three days a week in the office. We rate the statement FALSE."
,TRUE,Sara Jacobs,Government shutdowns in 2013 and 2018 “cost our economy billions of dollars each.”,,2024-12-18,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/dec/19/sara-jacobs/fact-check-past-government-shutdowns-cost-billions/,,"As Congress headed toward a potential pre-Christmas shutdown, some lawmakers warned that closing the government would not save taxpayer money. Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-Calif., criticized a push for mass cuts in federal spending by the Department of Government Efficiency, an incoming presidential advisory committee run by entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. Musk urged lawmakers to vote against a 1,500-plus page ""continuing resolution"" that would keep the government open. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., had negotiated the plan with House Democrats, whose votes he needed to pass it. Ramaswamy described the bill as ""full of excessive spending"" and said it ""should fail."" President-elect Donald Trump and JD Vance, the vice president-elect, rejected the spending deal that would fund the government through mid-March. ""Maybe someone should tell DOGE that government shutdowns aren’t efficient or cost effective?"" Jacobs wrote Dec. 18 on X, using the committee’s self-chosen abbreviation. ""The 2013 and 2018 ones (again led by House Republicans) cost our economy billions of dollars each."" Maybe someone should tell DOGE that government shutdowns aren’t efficient or cost effective? The 2013 and 2018 ones (again led by House Republicans) cost our economy billions of dollars each. Sign up for PolitiFact texts — Congresswoman Sara Jacobs (@RepSaraJacobs) December 19, 2024 In a video, Jacobs added that a government shutdown wouldn’t hurt Musk and Trump, both billionaires, as it would ""everyday Americans."" Government analyses and outside experts say Jacobs has a point that shutdowns can cost the economy, often measured in gross domestic product, billions of dollars. (Gross domestic product is the total monetary value of all goods and services a country produces.) ""Typically there is a shifting of activity across time and an overall loss of GDP in the single digit billions,"" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a center-right think tank. He cautioned, however, that even a shutdown that costs billions of dollars is modest in the context of a $27 trillion-plus U.S. economy. How much have past shutdowns cost? Congress has until late Dec. 20 to pass a bill that President Joe Biden would sign before 12:01 a.m. Dec. 21 to avoid a shutdown. Workers across the country would feel a shutdown’s effects. About 85% of federal workers are based outside the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. Shutdowns vary in scope and length, and calculating the cost of any particular shutdown is complicated. But government and private analysts have previously estimated that shutdowns hurt the economy. ""Government shutdowns decrease government spending, so these goods and services cannot be provided, directly decreasing output,"" the Congressional Research Service wrote in 2023. Shutdowns primarily affect discretionary spending, which accounts for about 27% of total federal spending. Shutdowns do not generally affect mandatory spending, such as Social Security, Medicare and interest payments on the national debt. Shutdowns also have indirect economic effects, notably federal workers reducing their own spending because they aren’t receiving their paychecks. Although federal workers are paid retroactively, a cash crunch at Christmastime could dampen retail sales and complicate travel. Steve Ellis, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan group that tracks the federal budget, told PolitiFact, ""Everyone agrees that shutdowns hurt the economy and taxpayers."" He cautioned, however, that a hit in one quarter can be partially made up in a later quarter. ""The federal government is going to spend that money, the work is going to get done,"" Ellis said. But he added that ""it won’t be as efficient, so shutdowns are always a waste of money and time."" A Jacobs spokesperson pointed to several data points, including a Congressional Budget Office estimate that the five-week partial government shutdown in 2018-19 reduced economic output by $11 billion during the following two quarters, including $3 billion that the U.S. economy never regained. Jacobs’ office also cited a government report that said the cost of pay for furloughed workers was $2 billion. Moody’s Analytics said the 16-day full-government shutdown in October 2013 reduced U.S. GDP growth by $20 billion. Another examination of the 2013 shutdown, by the White House’s Office of Management and Budget, found: 120,000 fewer private-sector jobs created in October’s first half. $500 million lost in visitor spending because of closed national parks. Interest accrued on billions of dollars of payments owed to third parties that the government couldn’t pay during the shutdown. Resources spent on putting activities in standby or maintaining them in an idle mode. 1.2 million Internal Revenue Service identity verification requests that couldn’t be processed, delaying private-sector lending and other activities. Stalled approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that delayed sending products to market. In 2013, Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi said the shutdown stunted fourth-quarter GDP growth by 0.5 percentage points, resulting in a $20 billion hit to the economy. Standard & Poor's found a similar lost amount. When Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said in 2014, ""It cost us more to shut the government down than to keep it open,"" we rated his statement True. With Republicans poised to control Congress, Paul has a different take, expressing support for Musk and criticizing Johnson.

,MOSTLY TRUE,Tony Evers,"“After 30 years of Wisconsin’s checking account running a deficit, we've ended every fiscal year I've been governor with a positive balance. Today, we have a $4.5 billion positive balance, and a record-high balance in our state savings account.""",,2024-12-28,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/jan/15/tony-evers/does-wisconsin-have-record-high-budget-balances-un/,,"State budget season is approaching in Wisconsin, which means you’re bound to start hearing words like ""surplus"" and ""rainy day fund."" Lawmakers craft a new spending plan every two years. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and Republicans who control the Legislature often disagree on whether to spend the state’s extra funds on programs, or give it back as tax cuts. Evers touted the state’s current financial standing Dec. 28, 2024, in an X post. ""After 30 years of Wisconsin's checking account running a deficit, we've ended every fiscal year I've been governor with a positive balance,"" he said. ""Today, we have a $4.5 billion positive balance, and a record-high balance in our state savings account,"" Evers added. Sign up for PolitiFact texts Wisconsin’s ""checking account"" refers to the general fund and its ""savings account"" is called the ""rainy day"" fund. We’ll refer to both in this fact-check. The general fund is where the state’s tax collections go, including income taxes, sales taxes and corporate taxes. The ""rainy day"" fund is home to excess tax revenue. It’s reserved in case the state takes in less revenue one year or spends more than expected. That’s helpful in a mild economic downturn, for example. With budget season approaching, let’s examine whether each part of Evers’ claim is correct. Along the way, we’ll try our best to explain the state government’s complicated financial accounts. Did Wisconsin’s general fund end with a positive balance each year under Evers? PolitiFact Wisconsin contacted the governor’s office, and Communications Director Britt Cudaback directed us to several sources, including the state’s Annual Comprehensive Financial Report. Here’s where things get confusing. The report is based on fiscal years, which run from the beginning of July to the end of June in Wisconsin. Cudaback said the claim treats 2020 as the first fiscal year under Evers’ leadership. Although Evers introduced his first budget in 2019, he took office halfway through that fiscal year. The 2017-19 budget former Republican Gov. Scott Walker signed was still in place then, Cudaback said. So, we’ll start at fiscal year 2020. Now, let’s see whether the general fund had a positive balance at the end of fiscal years 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024. The 2020 report showed a general fund balance of $1.5 million at the end of the year. In the next years, the balance reached the billions: $1.2 billion in 2021, $4.6 billion in 2022, $6.7 billion in 2023 and $4.5 billion in 2024. So, the first part of Evers’ claim is correct. There was a positive balance — or a ""surplus"" — in the state’s general fund for each fiscal year he’s been in office. Did Wisconsin’s general fund have a deficit for 30 years before Evers? Let’s look at part two of Evers’ claim: Did the general fund have a negative balance, or ""deficit,"" for 30 years before he became governor? For this piece, Cudaback pointed to a 2021 report from the nonpartisan Wisconsin Policy Forum. The report found the general fund had a surplus for the first time since 1990. That’s 30 years since Evers took office. ""For the first time on record, Wisconsin’s main fund closed the year with a small positive balance, wiping out the longstanding financial gap that was often referred to as a ‘deficit,’"" the report says. That was partly because of federal pandemic aid flowing into Wisconsin. The surplus fell this year because that money dried up, and the general fund is now spending more than it’s taking in, a December forum report said. Those 30 years included both Democratic and Republican administrations. But Evers is still correct that the general fund ran a negative balance for three decades before he became governor. Does the state have a record-high balance in its ""rainy day"" fund? The Legislative Fiscal Bureau has a chart that shows the balance of the ""rainy day"" fund between 2003-04 and 2021-22. It shows Wisconsin’s ""savings account"" did reach its highest balance in 2022, at $1.7 billion. The December Wisconsin Policy Forum report provides more recent numbers and projections: $1.8 billion in 2023, $1.9 billion in 2024 and $2 billion in 2025. Jason Stein, president of the Wisconsin Policy Forum, confirmed to PolitiFact Wisconsin that those are state records even if adjusted for inflation. So, yes, Wisconsin’s ""rainy day"" fund is growing and currently sits at a record balance. Does Evers deserve credit for these positive balances? Finally, one last piece. Although Evers doesn’t directly take credit for the state’s financial health in his tweet, it’s certainly implied. Cudaback provided several examples of Evers’ actions, like using extra revenue to pay off state debt in 2019 and transferring general fund money to the state’s capital budget in 2023 to prevent new borrowing. But the full picture is more complicated. Republicans have also taken credit for the surplus, pointing out their role in reining in Evers’ spending proposals. In 2023, Evers pitched a $104 billion budget, which Republicans mostly tossed and rewrote from scratch. The Wisconsin Policy Forum noted that if approved in full, Evers’ plan would have left the state with a deficit. However, Stein pointed out, Evers has vetoed Republican tax cut proposals, keeping the general fund higher than it would have been if he approved the cuts. ""To some degree, both the Legislature and the governor in the last budget did some things that were favorable in terms of boosting the general fund balance,"" Stein said. But each also had ""proposals that would have been less favorable (to the general fund) that were blocked by the other side. So in that sense, it was sort of a joint effort."" Beyond the political element, there’s also the overall state of the economy. If there was a recession, for example, tax collections from businesses could decline and the state might need to increase spending for people who lose their jobs and enroll in Medicaid, Stein said. So, Wisconsin’s financial health can’t really be credited to one person. But again, Evers doesn’t explicitly take responsibility in his tweet. Our ruling The three parts of Evers’ claim are correct: Wisconsin’s general fund has ended with a surplus each year he’s been governor, the fund had a deficit before that, and the ""rainy day"" fund is at a record balance. The state’s general fund surplus actually went down in the last year, in part because federal pandemic aid that boosted Wisconsin’s finances has dried up. Although Evers doesn’t explicitly take credit for the state’s financial well-being, he definitely hints at it. There’s evidence to support his involvement, the full picture is bigger. That includes the role of Republicans in paring down Evers’ budget proposal and broader economic conditions that influence how much money the state spends. For statements that are accurate but need clarification or additional information, we assign a Mostly True rating. That fits here."
,MOSTLY FALSE,Bernie Sanders,"H-1B guest workers are “being employed as dog trainers, massage therapists, cooks, and English teachers.”",,2025-01-02,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/jan/09/bernie-sanders/are-h-1b-visa-holders-hired-as-dog-trainers-massag/,,"A fight erupted on social media in late December pitting allies of President-elect Donald Trump against one another on the topic of visas for highly skilled immigrants. MAGA influencer Laura Loomer denounced the H-1B visa program that allows U.S. employers to hire foreign workers with certain skill sets. Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon called it a ""scam."" On the other side, billionaire Elon Musk, a former H-1B visa holder whose companies employ such visa holders, called for the program’s reform but defended it as an important talent recruitment mechanism. Trump, who sought reforms of the H-1B program during his first presidential term, sided with Musk. ""I have many H-1B visas on my properties,"" Trump told the New York Post in late December. ""I’ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It’s a great program."" Days later, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., disputed Musk, saying corporations abuse the program as a way to get richer and should recruit American workers first. Sign up for PolitiFact texts ""If this program is really supposed to be about importing workers with highly advanced degrees in science and technology, why are H-1B guest workers being employed as dog trainers, massage therapists, cooks, and English teachers? Can we really not find English teachers in America?"" During the 2024 campaign, Trump’s immigration agenda largely focused on promises to reduce illegal immigration; he didn’t talk much about work visas. But the recent social media battle may foreshadow tensions within the incoming Trump administration over the future of nonimmigrant visas. ""It is too early to tell which side will prevail in this battle,"" said Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, a retired Cornell University immigration law professor. ""People like Elon Musk want to preserve H-1B visas. Other Trump administration officials like Stephen Miller want to restrict all immigration, including H-1Bs."" We examined Sanders’ statement about the types of workers who obtain H-1B visas. Here’s the rub with his claim: Employers can — and have — sought foreign workers as dog trainers and massage therapists. But Sanders is plucking out very rare situations (teachers are more common). The majority of people with the visas have jobs in the tech industry, not the jobs Sanders cited. Majority of H-1B holders are in computer jobs, but some are teachers The H-1B visa program lets employers temporarily hire foreign workers in specialty fields. The majority of these workers have been hired in STEM occupations, with about two-thirds working in computer-related fields, according to the Congressional Research Service. STEM refers to science, technology, engineering and math occupations. Most H-1B visa holders come from India. Prospective H-1B employers must attest that they will pay the H-1B worker the greater of the actual wages paid to similar employees or the prevailing wages for that occupation. To qualify for the nonimmigrant visa, the worker must hold a specialized degree, license or training required by the occupation. The status is generally valid for up to three years and renewable for another three years, but can be extended if the employer sponsors the worker for a green card. Congress caps annual new H-1B visas at 85,000 per fiscal year, including 20,000 for noncitizens who earned advanced degrees. The program has long been a subject of debate. Proponents say the visas allow American employers to fill gaps and allow them to compete with other countries and recruit the ""best minds."" Critics point to fraud or abuse in the program and say they favor policies that incentivize hiring Americans. Employers apply to the Labor Department to use the program. Virtually every application is approved, allowing employers to apply for employee visas through the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and the Department of State. In 2023, most visa approvals were for people who work in computer-related jobs; 6% went to people working in education, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, although the agency’s data didn’t specify how many were English teachers. It also did not mention dog trainers, cooks or massage therapists. Asked for evidence behind Sanders’ statement, a Sanders spokesperson sent us links from a third-party website that showed employers’ Labor Department applications filed from 2020 to 2024 included requests for visas for dog trainers, massage therapists, English teachers and even cooks. But those links did not show whether the applications were approved (the government calls that ""certified"") or whether the employers were successful in getting the visas. And it represented a tiny speck of the applications — for example, three applications for the dog trainers, two for massage therapists and 10 for cooks. Requests for English teachers were more plentiful in the data Sanders’ office pointed us to — about 100 — but still represented a small fraction of the overall pool of applications filed during those years. ""There are a decent number of H-1Bs for English teachers, and that's not inappropriate because the jobs usually require a college degree,"" said David Bier, immigration studies director at the libertarian Cato Institute. ""They are usually teaching English as a second language, and many schools think it is helpful to know Spanish or another language while teaching English. It can be especially difficult for rural districts to find teachers in general, let alone ones with dual language ability."" The Dallas Morning News, a PolitiFact partner, reported that in fiscal year 2022, the Dallas school district sponsored 232 workers on H-1B visas, the largest number of any district in the country. Most of the H-1B holders were bilingual teachers in the district, where about half of the students do not speak English as their primary language. The district has hired teachers through the H-1B program for 25 years. Smaller school districts have also filled vacancies with H-1B visas. Jackson, Mississippi, public schools, which have about 17,000 students, have five high school English teachers on H-1B visas, plus teachers for math and science, said Sherwin Johnson, a district spokesperson. The teachers fill critical shortage areas, Johnson said. Nationwide teacher shortages, and scarcity of qualified bilingual teachers, have been widely reported. But does the United States have a shortage of dog trainers? Sanders is barking up the wrong tree here. The data Sanders’ sent us showed only two organizations that sought dog trainers, and we reached one of them. Patrick Glines, CEO of Guide Dogs of Texas, told PolitiFact that before he applied for a visa, he advertised for about two years to fill a position to train dogs for people who are blind, and had no luck. The job of training dogs for people who are blind is ""incredibly niche"" and is different from training a dog who has behavior issues, Glines said. It takes about three years until someone can do the job on their own. Glines ended up training a man in Chile, so he hired him through an H-1B visa. ""In this situation, it has been a significant help for us,"" Glines said. ""It is absolutely a one-off for me, I doubt I will ever apply for another one. In this one instance it has been incredibly beneficial for people who are blind in Texas."" The Labor Department posts employers applications online each quarter, and for the most recent quarter, most of the jobs we saw were within the tech and sciences sectors — some for cooks or teachers and only one for a massage therapist. Employers must prove that a job meets the visa requirements. ""Technically, the rule for H-1B is that the job requires the training that comes with at least a bachelor’s level education or its equivalent,"" said Daniel Costa, director of immigration law and policy research at the Economic Policy Institute. ""So if it is a specialized masseuse job that requires that level of education, theoretically it could qualify. The burden would be on the employer to make the case to USCIS."" Costa noted that a law firm wrote on its website that, ""Years ago, we saw H-1B approvals for a massage therapist, an airline pilot, and an assistant college sports coach. In most cases these jobs do not require a bachelor’s degree and would almost definitely not be approved today."" (The Massachusetts law firm has since closed.) We asked Sanders’ spokesperson whether he had data showing how many H-1B visa holders were ultimately hired as English teachers, cooks, massage therapists and dog trainers and did not get a reply to that question. To see what H-1B applications were granted, we would need access to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services data (generally filing Freedom of Information Requests with the federal government is a lengthy process.) Our ruling Sanders said H-1B guest workers are ""being employed as dog trainers, massage therapists, cooks, and English teachers."" Data shows the majority of the workers who obtain H-1B visas work in science and technology fields. In 2023, about 65% of approved petitions were for workers in computer-related jobs and 6% were in education, but they were not all English teachers. Although Sanders’ office pointed to a sampling of employer applications submitted to the Labor Department requesting visas for massage therapists, cooks and dog trainers, that data didn’t show how many actually got visas. And his statement ignored that in some cases even these occupations require specialized training, such as being able to train dogs for blind people or teaching students in two languages. By plucking out random applications, Sanders leaves voters with a distorted picture of the majority of the job titles held by H-1B visa holders.

Fox and Denzel Washington; and fashion industry figures Ralph Lauren and Anna Wintour. A social media user seemed to take grievance with the recipients and called on President-elect Donald Trump to revoke their awards. ""President Trump @realDonaldTrump can and must rescind all Presidential Medals of Freedom given to the Enemies of America,"" a Jan. 4 X post read. The user attached an answer by Grok, X’s generative artificial intelligence chatbot, which provided a supposed precedent for such an action. The query that prompted the conversation with Grok read: ""Can a president rescind the medal of freedom?"" ""Yes, a president can rescind the Presidential Medal of Freedom. While it is rare, there have been instances where a president has revoked this honor,"" Grok answered. ""For example, President Joe Biden revoked the Medal of Freedom awarded to former President Donald Trump's campaign manager, Bradley Birkenfeld, in 2021. The decision to rescind such an honor typically involves significant controversy or actions by the recipient that are seen as contrary to the values the medal represents."" Grok’s answer was also shared in a Jan. 4 Instagram post, which was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.) Sign up for PolitiFact texts Grok’s response contained four inaccuracies: Birkenfeld, a whistleblower, felon and former banker never received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Therefore, Biden could not have revoked it. Birkenfeld also wasn’t Trump’s campaign manager. Finally, no president has ever rescinded the medal. PolitiFact contacted X for comment but has not heard back. PolitiFact repeated the query to Grok on Jan. 6, and it gave a more detailed answer. It did not repeat the claim. Birkenfeld, a former banker for Swiss bank UBS, was imprisoned for his role in helping an American billionaire evade taxes. The IRS later gave him a $104 million whistleblower award, but no president awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. PolitiFact found no news reports or documents that proved he worked as Trump’s campaign manager. Searches for connections between Birkenfeld and Trump surfaced a 2021 report by The Atlantic about how Trump’s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski offered Birkenfeld’s associate a deal to secure a presidential pardon in exchange for a fee. Birkenfeld said he declined the offer. In 2015, after women accused actor and 2002 Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient Bill Cosby of sexual assault, a reporter asked former President Barack Obama whether he would revoke Cosby’s Medal of Freedom. Obama said there was no precedent and no mechanism to revoke the award. Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., introduced bills in the 114th Congress and 115th Congress to affirm the president’s power to revoke Cosby’s medal and to penalize anyone who ""wears or publicly displays a Presidential Medal of Freedom that has been revoked."" The bills weren’t passed. On its website, xAI, the company that developed Grok, says, ""Grok may provide inaccurate or inappropriate information. Since Grok has been trained on publicly available information, it can confidently provide misleading or factually incorrect information."" It tells users to ""carefully consider and verify Grok’s responses."" Biden did not revoke the Presidential Medal of Freedom for Birkenfeld; Birkenfeld had no medal to revoke. We rate that claim FALSE!"
,HALF TRUE,Dana Loesch,Buncombe County “is still demanding property taxes on homes destroyed by Hurricane Helene based on pre-Helene assessments that no longer apply.”,,2025-01-06,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/jan/17/dana-loesch/are-north-carolinas-helene-victims-still-required/,,"Some social media users are angry that North Carolina property owners must still pay full taxes on properties that were damaged after Hurricane Helene. The September storm was the deadliest and most damaging in state history. It brought 30 inches of rain, caused more than 1,400 landslides, and damaged about 74,000 homes in western North Carolina — where only about 5% of victims have flood insurance, according to an estimate by the state’s budget director. In a Jan. 6 X post, Buncombe County reminded residents to pay their 2024 property taxes before they become delinquent — prompting outrage from some users of the platform. ""This county is still demanding property taxes on homes destroyed by Hurricane Helene based on pre-Helene assessments that no longer apply,"" Dana Loesch, a conservative radio show host, told her 1 million X followers in a post. Other X users posted similar responses, suggesting that Buncombe should waive or reduce property taxes for people affected by Helene. Sign up for PolitiFact texts A viewer emailed WRAL-TV, PolitiFact’s North Carolina partner, asking if it’s true that Buncombe County and other counties in North Carolina are collecting taxes on Helene-damaged properties. The county is indeed collecting taxes. But Loesch’s focus on Buncombe makes it seem as though the county is doing something out of line. In fact, Buncombe — and other North Carolina counties that are collecting taxes — are acting in accordance with state law. Although receiving a hefty tax bill may feel like a bitter pill following the disaster of losing one’s property, the reality of the state’s taxation system gives counties little flexibility. Properties are taxed based on what their assessed values were as of Jan. 1 of that year. Buncombe County properties were last assessed in 2021 and those values are still in place. That means the damages from Helene aren’t reflected in the most recent tax bills. And they won’t be reflected until updated assessments are applied. Loesch and others on social media implied that Buncombe County should waive or change a property owners’ bill for 2024. State law prevents counties from doing that, so Buncombe officials can’t give Helene victims a break on their 2024 property tax bill — even if they wanted to. There’s an appeals process, but the deadline for that ended before Helene hit. Buncombe County officials are encouraging property owners to tell the county about damage to their properties, so that it can be reflected in the next assessment. What property owners are being taxed on Loesch wrote that properties are being taxed on assessments that ""no longer apply."" The property’s value as of Jan. 1 still applies to a property owner’s 2024 tax bill — even if it doesn’t reflect the current market value, or what someone might be willing to pay by the end of the year. Loesch didn’t respond to our questions about her statement. Here’s how the taxing process works: Counties assess the values of the properties within their borders. The assessments take into account recent comparable sales and other market factors into consideration. Property taxes are based on the assessed property value that is in place on Jan. 1 of that year, as well as the county’s tax rate. Most tax bills don’t go out until late summer, after the county’s property tax rate is set, and property owners have about three months to pay their tax bills. The bills are considered delinquent and can accrue interest if not paid before Jan. 6 (which is why Buncombe posted reminders on social media that day). Because properties are taxed based on their assessed value as of Jan. 1, damage from Helene doesn’t factor into the 2024 tax bill. Dia Harris, a North Carolina Department of Revenue spokesperson, told PolitiFact that the agency regularly fields questions from property owners about how disasters might affect their tax bill. ""A property owner whose residence is lost to fire during the calendar year will still be responsible for payment of taxes that are due on the property for that year,"" Harris said. ""And the bill must be based on the full value of the property’s condition as of Jan. 1 of that year."" Why are taxes based on a property’s value as of Jan. 1, as opposed to another date? The Jan. 1 date is set by state law and provides county governments with some insight into the size of their tax base, which is helpful for county leaders as they set the next fiscal year spending plan, said Chris McLaughlin, a professor of public law and government at UNC-Chapel Hill who posted about the issue in a Oct. 11 blog entry. If values go down after an assessment, for instance, county leaders might consider raising the tax rate to make up for lost revenue. State legislators ""chose Jan. 1 presumably because it is well in advance of the start of the fiscal year (July 1) for which taxes will be levied,"" McLaughlin told PolitiFact in an email. ""This provides the local government with some certainty about the size of its tax base (although there will be minor changes due to appeals) so it can accurately budget and decide upon a property tax rate before the fiscal year begins."" Counties can’t offer property tax exemptions Some social media posts suggested that Buncombe County should waive or postpone property tax bills. However, state law prohibits counties from doing that. The law reads: ""The governing body of a taxing unit is prohibited from releasing, refunding, or compromising all or any portion of the taxes levied against any property within its jurisdiction except as expressly provided in this subchapter."" Unless state legislators change the law, ""local governments may not waive property taxes as a response to a natural disaster,"" McLaughlin said. If Helene victims want immediate property tax relief, he said ""they should talk to their local representatives and tell them to pass a bill."" In the meantime, Buncombe is offering assistance in other ways. The county offers payment plans to property owners who want to avoid paying their tax bill in one lump sum. The county also offers financial assistance to low-income households in areas where increasing property value outpaces income. In advance of the 2025 tax bill, Buncombe officials are asking residents to inform them of any damage sustained to their properties. The county’s website features a banner: ""Please report damage to your home or property caused by Hurricane Helene."" Clicking the banner opens a form that Buncombe residents can fill out online and submit to the county. ""Property that is damaged as of Jan. 1, 2025, will see a reduction in 2025’s taxable value,"" said Kassi Day, a Buncombe County spokesperson. ""Our assessment team has been working hard to survey damaged areas so values can be updated to reflect the current situation."" Buncombe officials are also taking action that could limit the effect of property taxes in 2025. The county was scheduled to conduct a revaluation in 2025 — taking into account how market values have risen over the last four years. Buncombe’s Board of Commissioners recently voted to delay the county’s reappraisal of properties, allowing the 2025 values to remain based on 2021 market assessments. Our ruling Loesch said Buncombe County ""is still demanding property taxes on homes destroyed by Hurricane Helene based on pre-Helene assessments that no longer apply."" Buncombe and other counties are collecting taxes on properties even if they were damaged by Helene. But it’s inaccurate to suggest that the damage from Helene is relevant to the 2024 tax bill, which in North Carolina is based on a property’s assessed value as of Jan. 1, 2024 — months before Helene made landfall. Properties that lost value because of damage from Helene could see that reflected on their tax bill due in 2025, Buncombe officials said. Loesch and others on social media implied that Buncombe County should waive or change a property owners’ bill for 2024. Generally speaking, state law prevents counties from doing that. Loesch’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details that might influence someone’s understanding of the situation. We rate it Half True."

The Instagram post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Threads and Instagram.) The claims echoed October statements from President-elect Donald Trump, who falsely asserted following Hurricane Helene that the Biden administration had raided FEMA to pay for migrants. On Jan. 8, as California houses burned, Trump repeated his description of a penniless FEMA unable to help: Sign up for PolitiFact texts ""No water in the fire hydrants, no money in FEMA. This is what Joe Biden is leaving me. Thanks Joe!"" Trump wrote on TruthSocial. But FEMA isn’t broke. On Dec. 21, President Joe Biden averted a government shutdown by signing a federal spending bill that directed $29 billion to FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund, part of a broader $100 billion package for disasters in general. This came after calls for increased funding in the aftermath of Hurricanes Helene and Milton that struck the southeastern U.S. in September and October, respectively. Biden on Jan. 8 also approved California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s request for a major disaster declaration, a move that makes federal resources, including funding, readily available. A FEMA spokesperson told PolitiFact on Jan. 8 that Congress’ federal spending bill provided the agency with the funding and resources it needs to respond to California’s disaster. The Disaster Relief Fund balance is now about $27 billion, the spokesperson said. Congress funds migrant and disaster relief programs separately. And Trump’s administration, not Biden’s, shifted FEMA funding — including money from the Disaster Relief Fund — to address immigration. Starting in 2019, during Trump’s first term, Congress allocated money to FEMA to include some migrants in its Emergency Food and Shelter Program, which had previously been used only for people dealing with hunger and homelessness. The FEMA money was sent to local and state governments and nonprofit organizations to provide services to immigrants officials had released into the U.S. to await court proceedings. Trump’s term also saw the transfer of about $155 million from FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund to Immigration and Customs Enforcement in 2019 for the detainment of migrants. In 2023, Congress also directed FEMA and Customs and Border Protection to create the Shelter and Services Program to support nonfederal entities that offered shelter for migrants after they are released from the Department of Homeland Security. That program phased out support for migrants that drew from the Emergency Food and Shelter Program and its funding is allocated to Customs and Border Patrol but administered by FEMA. FEMA has previously addressed claims that its disaster relief funds have been diverted to immigration issues. ""This is false,"" the agency said in an Oct. 3 statement. ""Disaster Relief Fund money has not been diverted to other, non-disaster related efforts."" Joshua Sewell, research and policy director at Taxpayers for Common Sense, told PolitiFact in October, ""The Disaster Relief Fund has nothing to do with any migrant assistance account because all that spending is from separate funds."" We rate the claim that ""FEMA spent billions on illegal immigrants and now has no money for California"" Pants on Fire!

,TRUE,Robin Vos,"Voter ID ""is supported, if you look at any poll, by 70 to 80% of the public.""",,2025-01-08,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/jan/23/robin-vos/wisconsin-republicans-say-voter-id-laws-are-suppor/,,"Wisconsinites will soon have a chance to weigh in on the state’s voter ID law. The April 1 ballot will include a referendum question asking if the voter ID requirement should be enshrined in the state constitution. At a Jan. 8 news conference announcing the referendum, Republicans argued the majority of the public — including in Wisconsin — supports requiring voters to show their ID before getting a ballot. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said the referendum will allow voters an ""opportunity to give us their final say on something that is supported, if you look at any poll, by 70 to 80% of the public."" If the referendum fails, Wisconsin’s voter ID law would still remain in place. If passed, it would elevate the law to the state constitution, making it harder for the state Supreme Court to overturn it or future lawmakers to repeal it. ""The left has chosen one of the most extreme liberals to run for the state Supreme Court,"" Vos added, referring to Susan Crawford, who as an attorney represented plaintiffs challenging the voter ID law. Sign up for PolitiFact texts ""When 80% of the public in Wisconsin is in favor of an idea, I don’t know who would be afraid of that, except the person who’s with the 20% and is on the ballot,"" he said. So, Republicans are also saying this level of support exists in Wisconsin, not just nationwide. Let’s look at the most recent polling available. Nationwide surveys from 2024 found support even above 80% When PolitiFact Wisconsin contacted Vos’ office, his chief of staff, Jenny Toftness, pointed us to two polls, including a nationwide one Gallup released in October 2024. That poll found 84% of the public supports requiring voters to provide photo identification at their polling place, with 15% opposed. That support breaks down into 98% of Republicans who favor voter ID, compared to 84% of independents and 67% of Democrats, Gallup found. The poll randomly sampled more than 1,000 adults living in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, according to its methodology section. PolitiFact Wisconsin also looked at a similar poll conducted by the Pew Research Center, which state Rep. Scott Krug, R-Nekoosa, cited at the news conference. That poll was released in February 2024. That poll showed 81% support requiring government-issued photo identification to vote, with 18% opposed. That includes 95% of Republicans and 69% of Democrats. Marquette last polled Wisconsinites on voter ID in 2021, found 74% support Vos’ office also referenced the Marquette University Law School poll, considered one of the nations highest-quality polls. Marquette asked the following question across multiple polls in 2012, 2014 and 2021: ""Do you favor or oppose requiring a government-issued photo ID to vote?"" In a poll of Wisconsin registered voters released Aug. 11, 2021, 74% favored voter ID, and 21% opposed it. Five percent didn’t know, and 1% refused to answer. When broken down by party, support was at 92% among Republicans, 71% among independents and 55% among Democrats. Interestingly, 74% is a higher measure of support than when the Marquette poll asked the same question multiple times in 2012 and 2014. Support hovered around 60% for most of that period, dropping as low as 58% in a October 2014 poll, and reaching as high as 66% in January 2012, the first time the question was asked. Former Gov. Scott Walker signed the voter ID law in 2011, but it didn’t take effect until the 2016 presidential election cycle because of court challenges. Although that data is more than 3 years old, Republicans are still referencing the most up-to-date polling in Wisconsin, because Marquette hasn’t asked the question since 2021. Our ruling Vos said ""70 to 80% of the public"" in Wisconsin and the country supports requiring photo identification to vote. National polling from Pew and Gallup released in 2024 shows more than 80% of the public supports voter ID, including majorities of Democrats. The Marquette poll last asked about voter ID in 2021 and found support was at 74%, a jump from 2012 and 2014. Vos at one point said 80% of Wisconsinites support voter ID. That’s rounding up quite a bit, but he said 70% to 80% earlier in the press conference. And 74% is in the middle of that range. We rate his claim True."
,MOSTLY FALSE,JD Vance,"“Some of these (California) reservoirs have been dry for 15, 20 years.""",,2025-01-12,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/jan/17/jd-vance/fact-check-have-some-california-reservoirs-been-cl/,,"Asked about the emergency response to California’s wildfires, Republican Vice President-elect JD Vance criticized the state’s Democratic governor for making ""very bad decisions over a very long period of time,"" and pointed to the condition of the state’s reservoirs as an example. ""Some of these reservoirs have been dry for 15, 20 years,"" Vance said on Fox News Sunday as he spoke about Gov. Gavin Newsom. ""The fire hydrants are being reported as going dry while the firefighters are trying to put out these fires. There is a serious lack of competent governance in California, and I think it’s part of the reason why these fires have gotten so bad."" During the height of fighting the Palisades fire on Jan. 7 and Jan. 8, water demand outpaced the amount of water flowing to hydrants, and some hydrants went dry. A nearby city reservoir was empty for repairs when the fire broke out, the Los Angeles Times reported Jan. 10. But Vance’s description of decades-long dry reservoirs is misleading. Experts on California’s water management told us they were not aware of any major reservoir that has been dry for 15 years or more. The state-managed reservoirs in Southern California are, in general, at or above their historic average storage for January. The Santa Ynez reservoir that supplies drinking water to Los Angeles’ local system has been empty since February 2024 because it needed repairs. The reservoir can hold up to 117 million gallons. But it’s managed by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, not the state, and it’s used primarily for drinking water. Sign up for PolitiFact texts Had the reservoir been full, it may have supplied more water pressure to the Pacific Palisades during the height of the firefighting and slowed the rate at which hydrants ran dry, said Steve Margulis, the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering chair at the University of California, Los Angeles. But that reservoir hasn’t been closed for 15 years, so it’s unclear which reservoirs Vance was referring to. California has close to 1,500 surface reservoirs, a 2018 Public Policy Institute of California Water Policy Center report said. Most are small and managed by local governments, said Jay Lund, the vice director of the Center for Watershed Sciences and a civil and environmental engineering professor at the University of California, Davis. Some reservoirs are intentionally left at low levels or empty, Lund said, because they’re used for flood control. But those reservoirs fill during heavy rainfall to prevent flooding. It’s possible that a local reservoir somewhere in the state has been shut down for several years, but we did not find an example, and President-elect Donald Trump and Vance’s transition team did not provide examples when PolitiFact reached out for comment. ""I am sure there are very small reservoirs that have been empty for some time, for one reason or another,"" said Thomas Harter, a hydrology professor at the University of California, Davis. ""No major reservoirs have been empty for that long."" Small reservoirs that serve local areas outside of Los Angeles have no relation to the city’s water system. Los Angeles’ water comes from local aqueducts, groundwater and water purchased from Southern California’s Metropolitan Water District. The water district’s water is supplied by the Colorado River, groundwater and the State Water Project that moves water from the north to the dryer southern end. State Water Project Deputy Director John Yarbrough said in a statement to PolitiFact that there are ""no dry reservoirs in the State Water Project system."" Most of the major reservoirs tracked by the California Department of Water Resources are at or above their historic average storage. In a Jan. 12 interview with NBC News, Newsom rebutted Trump’s criticisms of Northern California water management and described Southern California’s reservoirs as ""completely full."" Although the nearby state reservoirs aren’t completely full, they’re close. The state-managed reservoirs in Southern California have stores above 75% of their total capacity. Newsom’s critics accused the governor of misleading by not mentioning the local empty Santa Ynez reservoir. After the interviewer noted the empty local reservoir, Newsom said, correctly, that the reservoir is not related to the state and federal water management system that Trump criticized early in the wildfire response. Newsom on Jan. 10 called for an investigation into why the Santa Ynez reservoir was empty when the Palisades fire broke out. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power said in a Jan. 11 press release it will conduct an investigation into water resiliency and how to better respond to climate-related disasters. Regardless of the amount of water in the pipes, though, hydrants and local water infrastructure are built for routine structure fires, not large wildfires that consume entire neighborhoods. The water may have slowed the fire in some places, but experts said it likely would not have dramatically contained the fire. Margulis told us it’s unclear how much that extra water would have helped, and the reservoir’s absence should be part of a post-fire investigation. ""Any additional reservoir would have helped maintain supply and pressure in the area that draws water from it for a longer period of time, but to what extent remains to be determined,"" he said. ""However, given the conditions, once the fire was ignited and started to spread quickly, it is unlikely that the extra supply would have made a major difference in containing it."" The Department of Water and Power in February 2024 shut down the Santa Ynez reservoir because of damage to its cover. The reservoir supplies drinking water to the city, so it’s subject to environmental regulations to prevent contamination. The department said the repairs are ""subject to the city charter’s competitive bidding process which requires time."" The Los Angeles Times reported a $130,000 contract was issued to a Lakeside firm to repair the cover. Upcoming investigations may determine that local government or management shortcomings contributed to a delay in repairing the reservoir. But the reservoir was shut down for less than a year, not 15 years or more. And it’s not indicative of a statewide problem with reservoirs. Our ruling Vance said that some reservoirs in California ""have been dry for 15, 20 years."" Experts said that statewide, there are no major reservoirs that have been dry for more than 15 years, and most of California’s reservoirs are above their historic average storage. One reservoir that supplies water to the Pacific Palisades area has been shut down for nearly a year, and that may have eased the water pressure shortage during the height of the firefighting. But Vance’s statement is exaggerated. It contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts. That’s our definition for Mostly False."

The mountain was called Mount McKinley from 1917 to 2015, when the Obama administration renamed it Denali. The Obama-era change followed decades of requests from Native Alaskan leaders for the mountain’s native name ‘Denali,’ a Koyukon Athabaskan word meaning ""the tall one,"" ""the high one"" or ""the great one"" to be restored. In his Jan. 20 order, Trump called the name change to Denali an ""affront to President McKinley’s life, his achievements, and his sacrifice."" The national park where the mountain is found will continue to be called Denali National Park and Preserve, Trump’s order said. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, for years has argued to keep the name Denali and criticized Trump’s move. Sign up for PolitiFact texts ""I strongly disagree with the President’s decision on Denali,"" Murkowski said in a Jan. 20 X post. ""Our nation’s tallest mountain, which has been called Denali for thousands of years, must continue to be known by the rightful name bestowed by Alaska’s Koyukon Athabascans, who have stewarded the land since time immemorial."" Is Murkowski right that the mountain has been called Denali for ""thousands of years""? PolitiFact asked four Native Alaskan language and cultural experts and a former cartographer involved in the 2015 name change to weigh in. ""It is not just thousands of years, but over 10,000 years,"" said James Kari, a linguist and an emeritus professor at the Native Alaskan Language Center who has specialized in the Dené or Athabaskan language family for 50 years. Native Alaskan place names have been in use for more than 13,000 years, Kari said. There is little written evidence of place names related to Native Alaskan tribes because they primarily have an oral tradition. But experts agree the name ""Denali"" has been passed down over several generations. ""We have this overlap of history and archaeology and geology that align with validating the longevity of Dené place names,"" said Taa’ąįį Ch’igiiontà, the Gwich'in language director of the Neetsaii Gwich'in tribe, citing other Native Alaskan place names that have endured for centuries. The Gwich'in language is part of the Athabascan language family. ""So, I think it's quite accurate for Murkowski to say that the name is thousands of years old."" A 2016 National Park Service article said, ""‘McKinley’ was incompatible with the Athabascan worldview because they rarely name places after people."" We asked Murkowski’s office for further information but received no reply. Trump’s order said the interior secretary shall reinstate the name Mount McKinley; the Senate has yet to confirm Trump’s interior secretary nominee, former North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum. Disputes over the mountain’s name are not new In 1975, Alaska’s Legislature passed a resolution requesting the mountain’s name to revert to Denali and Gov. Jay Hammond petitioned the federal government with this request. But the Ohio congressional delegation (where McKinley had been governor) blocked attempts to change the name. After McKinley’s assassination in 1901, ""there was just an outcry of grief, of course, (and) that they thought: ‘We need to remember this man, let's rename that mountain in Alaska, make it McKinley’ and it stayed that way,"" said Douglas L. Vandegraft, the Domestic Names Committee’s former chairman and retired cartographer for the Interior Department. Despite that, Native Alaskans continued to refer to the mountain as Denali. For Indigenous people, the government’s use of native names for places is important after centuries of colonization that sought to erase native culture and identity. ""It feels to some people like a small thing, but for Indigenous people, it's really important because it's a matter of recognizing that we are here, that we were stewards of these lands in many cases for millennia,"" Forest S. Haven, assistant professor of anthropology and Alaska Native Studies at the University of Alaska Southeast, said. ""Returning these place names points to that. It brings indigenous people into the present and puts us on the land in a way that we historically always were."" Our ruling Murkowski said, ""Our nation’s tallest mountain … has been called Denali for thousands of years.""

,MOSTLY FALSE,Mike Johnson,"“If there is culpability for what happened, there really need to be conditions that follow that aid. It’s not unprecedented, by the way. After Katrina, in my state, there were conditions placed upon the funds. It happened after Hurricane Sandy, up in the northeast. There’s a tradition of doing this.”",,2025-01-21,,Washington Post,,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/28/johnsons-misleading-claim-that-conditions-were-placed-katrina-sandy-aid/,,"Trump, when he visited North Carolina last week, said he wanted to get rid of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and simply have states submit a bill for reimbursement from the federal government. But that’s already largely how the system works, with FEMA repaying states for most of their expenses during a natural disaster. Congress then provides additional aid to help rebuild devastated areas and to fund improvements. Katrina and other hurricanes in 2005 caused such devastation in Louisiana and neighboring states — insured losses were estimated by insurance companies to total $57 billion — that 11 federal departments and four federal agencies provided nearly $122 billion in federal assistance to the Gulf Coast states, according to the Congressional Research Service. As a matter of course, congressional appropriations for disaster relief have conditions that determine eligibility, but that’s clearly not what Johnson is talking about. Such bills also include demands for regular reports from agencies handling the funding. Congressional appropriations often contain clauses that might withhold some funding unless certain parameters are met. We found that one Katrina bill authorized $12 million for a Louisiana hurricane protection study but stipulated the money would not be provided “until the State of Louisiana establishes a single state or quasistate entity to act as local sponsor for construction, operation and maintenance of all of the hurricane, storm damage reduction and flood control projects in the greater New Orleans and southeast Louisiana area.” But this was a relatively minor condition regarding a small amount of money, given the overall size of the rescue package. We can find virtually no news coverage of this condition by Congress — and there was wide agreement the previous system did not work. Previously, five different levee districts operated as separate local sponsors for federally built flood protection. The state in 2006 established the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority to oversee the levee districts. Congress eventually provided $14.5 billion to the Army Corps of Engineers to build a flood protection system that held firm in 2021 against Hurricane Ida. As for the Sandy legislation, Republicans in 2013 sought to amend $17 billion in relief to require a reduction in unrelated domestic spending — but that amendment was defeated. In defense of Johnson’s statement, his office pointed to the $12 million appropriation we had identified — which was rather minor in the context of almost $122 billion in aid. The office could not point to conditions on Sandy aid, and we couldn’t find any either. His office also highlighted some bills that over time have added broad conditions to aid, such as the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000, which required states and others to develop and update hazard mitigation plans as a condition to receive certain types of FEMA assistance, and the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006, which required states to include a catastrophic incident annex in state emergency preparedness plans that are required as a condition for assistance. The office also noted that Congress has placed conditions on community development block grants, required cost-sharing by states and demanded oversight of spending. But these are all general — not specific to a particular disaster such as the California wildfires. The Pinocchio Test Johnson suggested that congressional conditions imposed on aid after a disaster is “not unprecedented” and part of “a tradition.” As examples, he pointed to aid provided after Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy. But that’s greatly overstating the case. In Katrina, the only item we could find placed conditions on just $12 million in aid — out of tens of billions. We turned up nothing on Sandy. In reality, the tradition is that, after a disaster, virtually no conditions are placed on aid that would require a state to make policy changes. What would be unprecedented would be tying the aid to policy adjustments that have nothing to do with the disaster, such as mandating voter ID. Johnson earns Three Pinocchios."

Trump visited North Carolina on Jan. 24, four months after Hurricane Helene made landfall and damaged more than 73,000 homes. ""Earlier this month, the Biden administration kicked 2,000 displaced North Carolinians out of their temporary housing into freezing 20-degree weather,"" Trump said in Swannanoa. He promised that ""under the Trump administration, the days of betrayal and neglect are over."" The White House did not respond to our request seeking evidence. The number Trump cited matches a Jan. 11 Fox News report that said 2,000 North Carolina residents no longer met FEMA’s temporary housing eligibility requirements, and housing would continue for 3,600 households. Trump has a point in that several hundred North Carolina storm victims were told in January they had to leave their FEMA-funded hotels or motels because they no longer met the criteria for the stays. He misleads by overstating the number who lost eligibility, by omitting that they received three weeks’ notice to find new housing and by saying they were ejected into the cold. Sign up for PolitiFact texts Reviewing temporary housing eligibility after a disaster and removing some people from the program is a standard FEMA procedure that also happened during his presidency. Trump has floated the idea of eliminating FEMA, which would require congressional action. On Jan. 24, Trump ordered the formation of a council to review FEMA. FEMA announced extensions of transitional housing program FEMA’s Transitional Sheltering Assistance program provides free hotel and motel rooms for disaster victims as they repair their homes or find other housing. On Dec. 5, a FEMA news release said the temporary housing program in North Carolina was extended to Jan. 11. Of the 10,000 households that had used the program, about half had found longer-term housing. The agency reviews the participants’ cases every two weeks to see whether the participants still meet eligibility criteria. In January, multiple news reports said the Jan. 11 deadline would leave 2,000 to 3,500 households unsheltered during a snowstorm. (FEMA announced a 24-hour extension because of the storm.) About 3,600 households would remain eligible after Jan. 11, Fox reported. On the night of Jan. 11, FEMA extended the transitional sheltering hotel stays deadline until Jan. 14 and then extended it again until Jan. 25. North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein wrote a Jan. 16 letter to FEMA asking for an extension until Sept. 30 for eligible households as residents ""are experiencing chaos and uncertainty regarding temporary housing that is untenable."" FEMA replied Jan. 19 — the Biden administration’s last full day — extending the temporary shelter program until May 26. A FEMA spokesperson told PolitiFact that as of Jan. 28, more than 2,600 families remain temporarily housed in hotels or motels. Of those, approximately 740 were notified the weekend of Jan. 18 that they had 21 days to find new housing because they no longer met the criteria for the temporary housing. The most common reason people lost eligibility was that an inspector had called three times and received no response, FEMA said. Some people were no longer eligible because they missed an inspection or had checked out of their hotels. In Buncombe County, home to Asheville and one of the counties hardest hit by the hurricane, 407 households were no longer eligible for temporary housing as of Jan. 11 because FEMA had inspected their homes and deemed them safe to occupy, county spokesperson Lillian M. Govus said. An additional 143 households withdrew from the program and 49 households were homeless before the storm, making them ineligible. As of Jan. 28, 701 Buncombe households remain in the program. In a Jan. 16 interview with Fox News, Sen. Ted Budd, R-N.C., called on FEMA for better communication with its recipients, saying he had heard from some who believed they were wrongly evicted. Previous administrations, including Trump’s first administration, also had eligibility criteria for remaining in temporary housing. During Trump’s first term, a Feb. 16, 2018, FEMA news release about Texas hurricane victims said ""criteria review"" would determine who no longer qualified. ""Any sheltering option is, by design, a temporary, short-term solution, designed to be a bridge to middle- and longer-term solutions,"" Brock Long, then the FEMA administrator, said at a March 2018 House Homeland Security Committee hearing. North Carolina politicians said people were losing their temporary housing PolitiFact North Carolina partner WRAL reported Jan. 15 that ""dozens"" of people had been removed from hotels despite FEMA’s extension. That information was based on social media posts by North Carolina’s Republican senators, Budd and Thom Tillis. Budd wrote Jan. 14 on X that his office was ""hearing from dozens in (West North Carolina) who have been kicked out of their hotels tonight"" despite the extension. In an X post, Tillis said dozens of people were ""told their hotel vouchers expired despite not having a safe and livable home to go back to."" The same night, Budd wrote on X that his office had spoken with FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell and ""we are working through the list of those in need of lodging.""

Trump omitted the context about why they were removed — because they no longer met eligibility requirements — and that the removals are standard procedure that also happened during other disasters during his first administration.

Trump has suggested eliminating the agency, something that would require congressional action. He ordered a council form to review the agency and deliver a report in six months. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Congress may want to attach conditions, such as a debt limit increase, to California aid. That’s a ""shameful"" idea, Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Jan. 26 on NBC’s ""Meet the Press."" Schiff said Congress should not tie unrelated policy objectives to aid or view disaster aid requests through a partisan lens. ""And let me say this, as a Californian, we have given more to the recovery of other states than any other state in the union,"" Schiff said. Sign up for PolitiFact texts Responding to Johnson’s comments calling the idea of conditioning California aid ""a common-sense notion,"" U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., echoed Schiff’s sentiment. ""California is the largest contributor of tax revenue to the federal treasury by far,"" Padilla wrote Jan. 27 on X. ""In 2022 alone, California paid $83 billion more to the federal government than it received. Louisiana took $34.5 billion more federal dollars than it paid. Who is subsidizing whom here?"" We heard similar statements during Trump’s first presidency that California is a ""donor"" state – sending more money to the federal government than it gets in return. We found that Schiff cited a credible academic analysis, which requires some explanation. How a policy group calculates states’ ‘balance of payments’ A Schiff spokesperson cited analysis from the Rockefeller Institute of Government, a public policy arm of the State University of New York. For several years, the institute has examined the amount of federal taxes paid by each state’s residents and businesses compared with the amount of federal funding the state receives. The institute refers to the difference of those two numbers as the state’s ""balance of payments"" — a phrase used by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. who was elected to the Senate in 1976 and served 24 years. The institute’s most recent analysis, published in 2024, showed that California’s balance of payments was greater than any other state in the nation. California paid $83.1 billion more in federal taxes than it received from the federal government — a difference greater than any other state when measured in sheer dollars. The state remained a standout when its population was considered, but it didn’t lead all states. The analysis showed that per capita, Californians paid $2,129 more in federal taxes than they received — that’s more than all but three other states. So, Schiff was right that California’s federal funding contributions far outweigh what it gets from the federal government in return, but the disaster aid comparison is not as much of a straight line. ""The federal government does not have a separate, dedicated revenue stream exclusively for disaster aid,"" said Joel Tirado, an institute spokesperson. ""FEMA funding comes from general revenue aggregated nationally. So, it isn’t possible to know how much of California’s taxes go to disaster relief specifically."" Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the Tax Foundation, a center-right think tank, said policymakers in states such as California sometimes object that their taxpayers are subsidizing other states' taxpayers. But taxpayers are not being treated differently from one state to another. Low-income and high-income taxpayers will receive the same treatment whether they live in California, Nebraska or Arkansas, Walczak said. ""The difference is that California has more high earners than other states, and under a progressive tax and transfer system, high earners face progressively higher tax burdens which serve, in part, to fund programs that benefit lower-income households,"" Walczak said. ""It's not that Californians are subsidizing Arkansans: it's that high earners in California and Arkansas and everywhere else face higher tax burdens than low earners in California and Arkansas and everywhere else."" Joshua Sewell, research and policy director at Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan taxpayer advocacy group, said he agreed with Schiff’s general point because California’s economy and its contributions to federal revenues exceed every other state. ""That’s because federal lawmakers have taken those commingled funds generated from the income tax, customs duties, and excise taxes and redistributed them through federal programs,"" Sewell said. Brad Franklin, a research fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California, a nonpartisan think tank, said disaster response programs are implemented by many agencies and departments, which receive most of their funding from supplemental appropriations. ""That money ultimately comes from tax receipts, and California definitely pays more than its share,"" Franklin said. ""Putting things in per capita terms, as (the Rockefeller report) did, is helpful for thinking about tax burden per person. But total receipts are much more relevant to this question."" Our ruling Schiff said, ""As a Californian, we have given more to the recovery of other states than any other state in the union."" Schiff was citing the Rockefeller Institute of Government’s analysis of 2022 data. It showed California paid $83 billion to the federal government more than it received. This is not surprising since California is the most populous state. When that difference is calculated per capita, however, the figures showed that, compared with California, three other states paid more to the federal government than they received.

But one crack in his plan is that egg prices haven’t fallen since he took office Jan. 20. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, in her first on-camera press briefing Jan. 28, blamed that on former President Joe Biden’s ""inflationary policies."" Leavitt said the Biden administration and the U.S. Agriculture Department ""directed the mass killing of more than 100 million chickens, which has led to a lack of chicken supply in this country, therefore a lack of egg supply, which is leading to the shortage."" Leavitt’s statement is partially accurate about the culling of millions of chickens, but she omitted important details and context about why that happened. Sign up for PolitiFact texts First, the chickens were killed to prevent the spread of the highly pathogenic avian influenza, or bird flu. Second, it’s been long-standing USDA policy to cull an entire flock of birds once bird flu has been detected, including during Trump’s first administration. White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly referred PolitiFact back to Leavitt’s press briefing comments. Egg prices rose under Biden — from $1.60 per dozen in February 2021 to $4.10 in December 2024 (his first and last full months in office), Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows. The Agriculture Department’s January food price outlook said egg prices could rise about 20% more this year. A spokesperson for Expana, a company that tracks consumer prices, told Axios that a dozen large eggs costs more than $7 in some U.S. regions. Since Feb. 8, 2022, when the virus was detected in a commercial flock, more than 147 million birds, including chickens, turkeys, ducks and geese, have died, the USDA said. USDA data shows 108 million egg-laying chickens died since 2022, including 13 million in 2025. It’s not clear how many were euthanized or died of the virus. As of Jan. 29, bird flu has also been detected in dairy cattle, affecting 944 herds in 16 states, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows. Humans have also tested positive for the virus — 67 confirmed cases have been reported in the U.S. and one person has died, the CDC said. Why are flocks culled? Experts told PolitiFact the birds are culled to stop the virus from spreading. This protects not only nearby farms and the poultry industry, but public health. A 2002 federal law, the Animal Health Protection Act, gives the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service authority to depopulate herds and flocks to stop the disease’s spread. ""If the birds are dead, the virus dies along with them,"" Russ Daly, a veterinarian for the South Dakota Department of Health and a South Dakota State University professor, said. Chickens that contract the bird flu virus have little chance of survival; 90% to 100% of them die, usually within 48 hours, the CDC said. Waiting for the chickens to die naturally allows more viral load into the atmosphere, making it more dangerous for the farm workers and other people who come in contact with the farm, Jada Thompson, a University of Arkansas agricultural economics and agribusiness associate professor, said. Is this policy new? Several veterinary professors told PolitiFact that depopulation or ""stamping out"" of sick birds is a long-standing policy and pointed to a 2015 bird flu outbreak during the Obama administration. Depopulation is the USDA’s primary control and eradication strategy for avian influenza, Yuko Sato, a veterinarian and Iowa State University associate professor, said. ""This latest outbreak is devastating because of the large numbers of premises involved since 2022,"" Carol Cardona, a University of Minnesota veterinary professor and chair of avian health, said. ""But the rule has been there for a very long time now."" A 2016 USDA report shows that depopulation in 2015 resulted in 50 million birds killed. A USDA bird flu response plan, updated in May 2017 during Trump’s first administration, incorporates policy guidance based on lessons from influenza outbreaks during the Obama and first Trump administrations. It said ""rapid depopulation of infected poultry is critical to halt virus transmission and must be prioritized."" During a March 2017 bird flu outbreak, a USDA report said, ""nearly 253,000 birds were depopulated."" How does depopulation work? The USDA encourages farmers who notice signs of illness to contact the USDA or their state veterinarian. Samples taken from the animals are tested and the USDA confirms cases; depopulation usually takes place within 48 hours of the virus’s confirmation. The USDA pays the farmers for the killed birds. ""It’s in the best interest of the farmer to get this done quickly, as the USDA provides indemnity payments for the euthanized birds, but not the ones that die naturally,"" Daly said. Our ruling Leavitt said there’s an egg shortage because the Biden administration ""directed the mass killing of more than 100 million chickens."" During the Biden administration, more than 100 million egg-laying chickens died from bird flu or were killed to stop the virus’ spread. This led to an egg shortage and higher prices. Depopulation is a long-standing practice to prevent bird flu from spreading, agriculture experts said. Government documents show depopulation was the USDA’s bird flu strategy during Trump’s first term and during the 2015 outbreak under Obama. Leavitt’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details and context. We rate it Half True."

A State Department spokesperson said on X that the freeze stopped $100 million in funding to Gaza which included funding for contraception. But the emergency relief group that, according to news outlets, would have received that aid, told PolitiFact it did not use U.S. funding for condoms. There is a U.S. program that provides contraceptives internationally — and it spent $60 million worldwide in one year — but Gaza was not among the recipients, a 2024 U.S. Agency for International Development report said. Here’s what we know about the funding the White House froze to Gaza, and the funding the U.S. gives other countries for contraceptives. White House stopped $100 million of health aid to Gaza State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in an X post that the department ""prevented $102 million in unjustified funding to a contractor in Gaza, including money for contraception."" The state Department declined to say on the record what the full scope of those grants was, and it did not provide documentation PolitiFact requested before deadline. Multiple news outlets reported that state department officials said the administration stopped two $50 million tranches of funding for the International Medical Corps’ work in Gaza. The funding ""included"" family planning programming, which can include contraception, sexual health care and sexually transmitted disease prevention. The International Medical Corps operates a range of emergency health services in Gaza, but spokesperson Todd Bernhardt told PolitiFact it has not used U.S. funding to buy or distribute condoms in Gaza. The organization is not focused on contraception, and there’s no evidence that $50 million of the funding was intended to pay for condoms. The International Medical Corps operates two field hospitals in Gaza, Bernhardt said, which serve around 33,000 civilians per month. It performs emergency maternal and newborn care and has helped deliver about 5,000 babies since the war in Gaza began, Bernhardt said. It operates a neonatal intensive care unit and a stabilization center for severely malnourished children. The group also provides care in pediatrics, orthopedics, pulmonology and cardiology, Bernhardt said. ""If the stop-work order remains in place, we will be unable to sustain these activities beyond the next week or so,"" Bernhardt said. Since the war in Gaza began in October 2023, the International Medical Corps has received $68 million to support its operations, Bernhardt said. We weren’t able to review the details of the grant Leavitt referred to, but it is unlikely the group would receive close to three-fourths of all the funding it’s received so far for condoms alone. And the State Department did not respond to our request for more details on the grant. The Trump administration on Jan. 29 withdrew its memo that directed a freeze on most federal aid a day after a judge blocked the effort, but Leavitt said on X the funding freeze was still in place. The State Department did not say whether the planned Gaza aid would resume. No contraceptives funding went to Gaza in fiscal year 2023, the latest available data For decades, the U.S. has invested in reproductive health and family planning programs worldwide. Public health groups distribute condoms in low-income countries primarily to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV. The U.S. ""is the largest donor to (family planning/reproductive health) in the world. It is also one of the largest purchasers and distributors of contraceptives internationally,"" according to a 2024 KFF report. The U.S. spends about $600 million annually on international family planning and reproductive health programs globally, the KFF report said. That includes things like birth spaces, STD testing, prenatal and postnatal care, and other interventions beyond contraception. According to USAID, it partners with 41 countries for its family planning and reproductive health program. Neither Israel nor Gaza and the West Bank are on the list. In fiscal year 2023, which ended in September 2023, the U.S. government spent $60 million on contraceptive care which includes condoms, a 2024 USAID report said. A small portion of that — $8.2 million — was spent on male and female condoms, with the rest going to other contraception methods. The majority of the funding, $54.3 million went to countries in Africa. The Middle East, where Gaza is, got the smallest funding share — about $45,000. All the funding to the Middle East went to Jordan; the report didn’t mention any funding to Israel or Gaza. Most of USAID’s Family Planning Program funding is used on contraceptives other than condoms such as oral contraceptives, injectable contraceptives and contraceptive implants. Around $7 million went to condoms for men. Gaza has around 2.14 million people, according to the CIA. If the U.S. spent $50 million on condoms it would have spent around $23 on condoms per person in Gaza or about $46 per male in Gaza. On average, condoms cost about $1 each, according to Planned Parenthood. That does not include a likely lower price for bulk purchases. Our ruling Leavitt said officials found ""there was about to be $50 million taxpayer dollars that went out the door to fund condoms in Gaza."" The White House and State Department didn’t provide evidence the funding it blocked was intended solely for condoms. A State Department spokesperson said that the freeze stopped $100 million in funding to Gaza that included funding for contraception. But there’s no evidence the emergency relief group that would have received that aid would have used it for condoms; a spokesperson for the group said it has not used any U.S. aid so far to procure or distribute condoms. A separate U.S. program that provides contraceptives internationally spent $60 million worldwide in one year, but Gaza was not among the recipients. We rate Leavitt’s statement False."
,HALF TRUE,Elizabeth Warren,Robert F. Kennedy Jr. “made $2.5 million off suing one of the entities that (he would be regulating) and plans to keep getting a take of every lawsuit in the future.”,,2025-01-29,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/jan/30/elizabeth-warren/whats-the-evidence-rfk-jr-profited-off-vaccine-law/,,"During health secretary nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s Jan. 29 Senate confirmation hearing, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., grilled Kennedy over his involvement in lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers. ""In the past two years, you’ve raked in $2.5 million from a law firm called Wisner Baum,"" Warren said. ""You go online, you do commercials to encourage people to sign up with Wisner Baum to join lawsuits against vaccine makers."" Warren said Kennedy gets paid for everyone who signs up, and if Wisner Baum wins the case, Kennedy receives 10% of the legal fees. ""Have we had a single nominee come through who’s made $2.5 million off suing one of the entities that it would be regulating, and plans to keep getting a take of every lawsuit in the future?"" Warren asked Senate Finance Committee chairman Mike Crapo, R-Idaho. When PolitiFact contacted Warren’s office, a spokesperson clarified that the senator was referring to Wisner Baum suing pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. over allegations it failed to properly warn patients about risks associated with Gardasil, the vaccine that protects against human papillomavirus. HPV is a common sexually transmitted disease that can cause cancers later in life. Sign up for PolitiFact texts Over the past two years, Kennedy collectively earned more than $2.4 million as a consultant referring cases to Wisner Baum, according to financial records he filed with the federal government for his health secretary nomination and 2024 presidential run. Warren’s office pointed to these financial records as evidence to support the senator’s hearing remarks. PolitiFact also contacted Kennedy’s team, but received no response before publication. Kennedy’s financial records show that in 2024, Wisner Baum paid Kennedy $856,559 for his consultant work. In 2023, Kennedy earned $1,589,829 for his work at Wisner Baum, records show. The documents don’t say for which cases Kennedy received compensation. A Wisner Baum spokesperson said in a statement responding to Warren’s hearing remarks that the law firm has not compensated Kennedy for vaccine cases. Wisner Baum said it has paid Kennedy only for cases related to the herbicide Roundup and 2018 California wildfires. Kennedy’s bio on Wisner Baum’s website lists his work on these cases, and the lawsuits against Merck. As Health and Human Services secretary, Kennedy would oversee the Food and Drug Administration, an agency that regulates companies such as Merck and Monsanto, which produces Roundup. Warren’s office said in a statement that the money Kennedy earned from Monsanto-related cases shows he has already profited from lawsuits against an entity he would oversee. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., questions Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Donald Trump's pick for Department of Health and Human Services secretary, as he testifies before the Senate Finance Committee during his confirmation hearing at the Capitol in Washington, Jan. 29, 2025. (AP) The first jury trial against Merck’s Gardasil vaccine began Jan. 21 in a state court in Los Angeles. Separately, there is an ongoing federal court case against Merck involving almost 200 lawsuits filed since 2022 in North Carolina, where one of Merck’s vaccine manufacturing facilities is based. Wisner Baum is involved in both cases. Kennedy wrote in his ethics agreement that, if confirmed as health secretary, he would resign from his Wisner Baum consultant position, which he has held since 2016. However, Kennedy said he will continue to receive compensation from the firm for certain cases. ""I am entitled to receive 10% of fees awarded in contingency fee cases referred to the firm,"" Kennedy wrote in his ethics agreement. ""I am not trying these cases, I am not an attorney of record for the cases, and I will not provide representational services in connection with the cases during my appointment to the position of Secretary."" Kennedy wrote that, if confirmed, he will receive one final payment from Wisner Baum for all completed cases involving the U.S. government. This includes claims filed under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, a federal program established in 1986 that allows people who say they were injured by vaccines to seek compensation. The disclosure documents did not say how much that payment is expected to be. For ongoing and future legal cases involving the U.S. government, Kennedy wrote that he will not receive payment. However, if the Department of Health and Human Services’ ethics office says the government is not a party in a case and doesn’t have a ""direct or substantial interest,"" the ethics agreement said, then Kennedy can collect contingency fee interest from Wisner Baum. So, if Kennedy is confirmed as health secretary, he could receive substantial compensation from Wisner Baum for his previous referral work in the event the law firm wins or settles its cases against Merck. Following the hearing, Kennedy submitted written answers to the committee’s follow-up questions. In it, he wrote that he had not yet received compensation from Wisner Baum related to any lawsuit against Merck related to Gardasil. ""An amendment to my Ethics Agreement is in process, and it provides that I will divest my interest in any such litigation,"" he said. When asked if he or any family members ""ever received, or expect to receive, any compensation from Wisner Baum from any lawsuit against Merck related to Gardasil,"" Kennedy wrote he was amending his ethics agreement to send any proceeds from the suit to go to his son. Kennedy did not say which son, although his son Conor Kennedy is an attorney at Wisner Baum. Government documents show that Kennedy resigned from his positions as chairman and chief legal counsel for Children’s Health Defense in December 2024. He earned $326,056 in salary and benefits from the antivaccine group for three months of work in 2023 before taking an unpaid leave of absence April 1, 2023. A few days later, on April 5, 2023, Kennedy filed candidacy paperwork with the Federal Election Commission for his 2024 presidential run. Kennedy has made numerous false claims about vaccines, including ones that protect against COVID-19 and HPV. These falsehoods were part of Kennedy’s presidential campaign of conspiracy theories that PolitiFact named the 2023 Lie of the Year. Kennedy has said receiving the HPV vaccine Gardasil increases cervical cancer risk. There’s no evidence for that. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — an agency Kennedy will oversee if confirmed as Department of Health and Human Services secretary — said the HPV vaccine is safe and effective in preventing HPV infection. The CDC recommends two doses of the vaccine at ages 11 to 12. The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia said that ""because the HPV vaccine is made using only a single protein from each type of the virus, it can’t cause HPV infection, and, therefore, it can’t cause cervical cancer or other cancers."" Our ruling Warren said Kennedy ""made $2.5 million off suing one of the entities that (he would be regulating) and plans to keep getting a take of every lawsuit in the future."" Warren was referring to Kennedy’s consulting work for Wisner Baum. Kennedy’s financial records show he earned more than $2.4 million over two years from his work referring cases to Wisner Baum. On its website, Wisner Baum touts Kennedy’s work on its vaccine-related litigation against Merck as well as on other cases. However, it’s not clear from Kennedy’s financial records which legal cases Wisner Baum has paid him for. The law firm asserts it has compensated Kennedy only for non-vaccine related litigation, including for cases related to the herbicide Roundup, which is owned by a company the FDA regulates. If confirmed as health secretary, Kennedy said in an ethics agreement that he would continue to receive compensation from the law firm for certain legal cases. He said he would receive one last payment from Wisner Baum for his prior work on government-related cases, but would otherwise stop receiving payment for cases involving the U.S. government. It is possible that adhering to that promise would still leave room for Kennedy to receive payment from cases related to companies he regulates, if the Department of Health and Human Services’ ethics office determines the lawsuits don’t involve the U.S. government. In answer to follow-up questions to the committee, Kennedy later said he was amending his ethics agreement to divest his interest in any such litigation and said he would give future proceeds from such lawsuits to his son. Warren’s claim is partially accurate — Kennedy has received $2.4 million related to lawsuits, some of them involving entities he would regulate as health secretary, and an ethics agreement said he expects to continue to receive payment from a law firm engaged in suing pharmaceutical companies, although Kennedy later said he would change that to send any such payment to his son instead. But Warren omitted this important context: Kennedy’s financial disclosures don’t make clear what lawsuits he was paid for. The Wisner Baum law firm says Kennedy has been compensated only for non-vaccine-related cases. The available evidence for this claim fits our definition of Half True. PolitiFact Researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report. UPDATE, Jan. 31, 2025: This story has been updated to include information from written documents that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. submitted to senators following his Jan. 29 hearing. In them, he said he would amend his ethics report to divest himself of any future profits from lawsuits stemming from litigation involving Merck and would instead direct such profits to his son.

,FALSE,Donald Trump,“I changed the Obama policy (on hiring air traffic controllers) ... And then Biden came in and he changed it.”,,2025-01-30,,PolitiFact,,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/jan/31/donald-trump/trump-faults-dei-hiring-in-plane-crash-and-falsely/,,"Hours after a plane crashed over the Potomac River a few miles from the White House, President Donald Trump held a press briefing in which he blamed his predecessors’ diversity hiring policies as a possible reason for the accident. Sixty-seven people were presumed dead after an American Airlines passenger jet collided in midair with an Army helicopter near the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport on Jan. 29. The victims included three U.S. service members aboard the helicopter and everyone aboard the plane, including several young figure skaters, a civil rights lawyer, a newlywed, a pilot and several flight attendants. Trump started his Jan. 30 press conference with a moment of silence but pivoted to blame Democratic Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, who Trump said led Federal Aviation Administration diversity programs that inspired the agency to hire unqualified air traffic control employees. Trump said he ended those initiatives in 2017 when he was first elected, but Biden reinstated them. ""I changed the Obama policy, and we had a very good policy,"" Trump said. ""And then Biden came in and he changed it. And then when I came in two days, three days ago, I signed a new order, bringing it to the highest level of intelligence."" Trump read from a Fox News headline that said the Federal Aviation Administration diversity hiring initiative ""includes focus on hiring people with severe intellectual and psychiatric disabilities."" Trump said it came out a week before he took office, but it was published Jan. 14, 2024. After the press conference, the White House also pointed to an Obama-era biographical assessment for air traffic controllers that critics said prioritized diversity over skills. Sign up for PolitiFact texts A close look at the FAA’s hiring policies under Obama, Biden and Trump shows that Trump mischaracterized the policies and misled about his actions and the actions of his White House predecessors. He also provided no evidence these policies had any connection to the fatal crash. The crash has generated renewed concerns about air traffic controller staffing, and the cause remains under investigation. Experts warned against singling out any specific cause of the crash, including diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, less than 24 hours after it occurred. Trump expanded — not withdrew — a hiring initiative aimed at people with disabilities In 2010, Obama’s administration issued an executive order directing federal agencies to hire more people with disabilities, noting that although 54 million people in the U.S. have disabilities, they were underrepresented in the federal workforce. The FAA incorporated the directive into its hiring practices. That didn’t stop when Trump took office in 2017. Archives of the FAA’s website show the agency continually highlighted its diversity hiring initiatives, including its aims to hire people with disabilities, from 2013 up until Trump reclaimed office in 2025, including throughout Trump’s first term, 2017 to 2021. The page was taken down after Trump was inaugurated Jan. 20. During his Jan. 30 press conference, Trump maligned a list of ""targeted disabilities,"" including severe intellectual disabilities, saying their emphasis in hiring was unique to his predecessors. The term ""targeted disabilities"" is legally defined across the federal government to include ""hearing, vision, missing extremities, partial paralysis, complete paralysis, epilepsy, severe intellectual disability, psychiatric disability and dwarfism."" Yet in 2019, also under Trump’s first term, the FAA launched a program that aimed to hire 20 people with disabilities to be air traffic controllers, including people who have these ""targeted disabilities."" In its April 11, 2019, press release, the agency said the program’s key focus was to ""identify specific opportunities for people with targeted disabilities, empower them and facilitate their entry into a more diverse and inclusive workforce."" After being sworn in for his second term, Trump on Jan. 20 and Jan. 22 signed executive orders aimed at shutting down diversity programs in the federal government, including the FAA. The White House confirmed Jan. 30 that Trump’s executive orders did away with those goals. Trump ended a controversial Obama-era hiring protocol, but Biden did not reinstate it In 2014, the Obama administration launched a hiring assessment for air traffic controllers that weighed biographical information such as work and education experience and personality traits as part of a person’s application. The training standards for those who were hired didn’t change. The assessment did not ask specifically about race, but critics said it was designed to create a more diverse hiring pool at the expense of people who were more qualified or performed better on skills tests. People who failed were not allowed to continue with their application. The FAA introduced the assessment into its hiring protocol in 2014 after it commissioned a study of the barriers racial minorities and women face in becoming air traffic controllers. Throughout his first term, the Trump administration defended the Transportation Department in a lawsuit over the assessment, which plaintiffs said was discriminatory. Trump’s administration and Biden’s administration both denied in court that the process favored nonwhite applicants. Nevertheless, in 2018, Trump jettisoned its use of the air control biographical assessment, the White House said. Biden’s administration did not reinstate the assessment, and it has not been a part of the application process since 2018. All air traffic controllers undergo rigorous tests regardless of disability All air traffic controllers need to pass skills and medical tests to be hired, air traffic management experts told PolitiFact. That didn’t change under either hiring initiative. Some disabilities could be disqualifying, Margaret Wallace, an aviation management professor at Florida Institute of Technology, said. Some examples could include heart conditions or neurological issues that might unexpectedly incapacitate a person, or ""poor or no vision, color blindness, poor or no hearing, speech issues that could affect the ability to communicate as needed,"" Wallace said. Michael McCormick retired from the FAA in 2015 after working under Republican and Democrat administrations, and his work included hiring controllers. He said most of the conditions Trump listed would not meet the agency’s medical standards. ""The decision to hire a controller is solely based upon aptitude testing, medical certification and security investigation,"" McCormick said. Our ruling As he speculated about the Jan. 29 air crash’s cause, Trump said ""I changed the Obama policy (on hiring air traffic controllers) ... And then Biden came in and he changed it."" The White House said he was referring to two separate policies. The first was a push to hire more people with disabilities that started under Obama. Trump didn’t end the initiative — he expanded the effort by announcing a program aimed at hiring 20 people with disabilities to be air traffic controllers. All air traffic controllers had to pass medical, security and skills tests, regardless of any disability. The second involved an Obama-era hiring assessment that critics said prioritized diversity over qualifications. Trump was wrong to say that Biden reinstated it — he did not. The assessment has not been in place since 2018, when Trump ended it. But even under that practice, training standards did not change. Trump conflated policies, obfuscated about his role in them and misled about what they did. Investigators are still piecing together what led to the crash, a process that could take months. Trump’s leap to connect these policies to what unfolded over the Potomac has no basis. We rate the claim False."
