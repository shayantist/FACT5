      "Statement Evaluation 5\n",
      "Statement: On December 01, 2024, Jay Rothman claimed: “The Universities of Wisconsin are 43rd out of 50 states in the nation, in terms of public support for our universities. The $855 million (budget request) gets us up to average.”\n",
      "Overall Verdict: MOSTLY TRUE\n",
      "Overall Confidence: 0.7\n",
      "Overall Reasoning: The first claim, that Jay Rothman stated Wisconsin universities rank 43rd out of 50 in public support, is mostly true.  Sources confirm Wisconsin's low ranking in higher education funding, although the exact ranking and the precise date of Rothman's statement require further verification. The second claim, that an $855 million budget increase would bring Wisconsin to the national average, is unverifiable. While the budget request is documented, whether it would actually achieve the stated goal is not supported by the evidence.  Since one claim is mostly true and the other unverifiable, the overall statement leans towards being mostly true, but the lack of definitive proof for the second part reduces the confidence level.\n",

      "Claims Extracted & Independently Verified:\n",
      "Claim 1/2: On December 01, 2024, Jay Rothman claimed that the Universities of Wisconsin are 43rd out of 50 states in the nation in terms of public support.\n",
      "Verdict: MOSTLY TRUE\n",
      "Confidence: 0.8\n",
      "Reasoning: The claim states that on December 1, 2024, Jay Rothman claimed Wisconsin universities rank 43rd out of 50 states in public support.  The provided QA pairs confirm that Wisconsin ranks 43rd among states in public funding for four-year higher education.  While the exact dollar amount isn't specified, the ranking itself is supported by the evidence.  The claim accurately reflects Rothman's statement, assuming he made it on the specified date.  The lack of information on the exact date of Rothman's statement is the only uncertainty.\n",
      "Question: What is the ranking of states in terms of per-student public funding for higher education?\n",
      "Answer: I cannot provide a definitive ranking of states by per-student public funding for higher education based on the provided documents. While some documents mention states with high per-student expenditures (e.g., New York and Connecticut [3]), a complete ranking is not available.  Other sources discuss overall state spending [2, 8, 9] and trends in funding [1, 4, 6], but not a ranked list by per-student funding. \n",
      "\n",
      "Reasoning: Several sources provide information on state higher education funding, but a precise ranking of states by per-student funding is not readily available in the provided text.  Document [3] mentions New York and Connecticut as having high median expenditures per student, but doesn't offer a complete ranking.  Other documents discuss overall state spending on higher education [2, 8, 9] or trends in funding [1, 4, 6], but lack a definitive state-by-state ranking based on per-student funding.  Document [5] provides a ranking of states in higher education, but this ranking is not explicitly based on per-student funding.  Document [7] mentions a range of per-student appropriations in 2016-17, but again, doesn't provide a full ranking.\n",

      "Question: Considering the current funding level and ranking of the University of Wisconsin System, would an additional $855 million in state funding be sufficient to raise its ranking to the national average?\n",
      "Answer: The University of Wisconsin System currently ranks 43rd nationally in per-pupil funding [1, 2, 5, 8].  A proposed $855 million increase in state funding over two years aims to improve this ranking [6]. While increased funding generally leads to better college rankings [7], the provided text does not definitively state whether this amount would be enough to reach the national average.  The documents emphasize the negative consequences of underfunding on student enrollment and graduation rates [9, 10], but don't establish a direct correlation between a specific funding increase and a specific ranking improvement. \n",
      "\n",
      "Reasoning: The provided text states that the University of Wisconsin System currently ranks 43rd nationally in per-pupil funding [1, 2, 5, 8].  An additional $855 million in state funding over two years has been requested to improve this ranking [6]. While increased funding correlates with improved college rankings [7], the documents don't directly state whether this specific amount would be sufficient to raise the UW System's ranking to the national average.  The documents highlight the negative impact of underfunding on enrollment and completion rates [9, 10], but don't offer a direct causal link between a specific funding increase and a specific ranking improvement.  The current funding level is significantly below the national average [3], but the relationship between funding and ranking is not explicitly quantified.\n",
