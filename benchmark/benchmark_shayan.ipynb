These include extending tax cuts, passing the Limit, Save, Grow Act, and the REIN IN Act.

      "Reasoning: The answer is based on analyzing the provided documents which highlight several key votes by House Republicans. These include extending tax cuts, passing the Limit, Save, Grow Act, and the REIN IN Act. While these measures aim to promote economic growth, they also carry potential risks such as increased deficits, reduced government investment, and higher interest rates, which could harm economic growth.\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\n",
