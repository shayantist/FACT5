0,Mostly False,"The statement that the National Guard only gets called in after a disaster, not before something happens, is not entirely accurate. The National Guard can be and often is mobilized before anticipated events that are likely to require intervention, such as natural disasters (like hurricanes or floods), large public events where safety could be a concern, or anticipated civil unrest based on prior intelligence. This proactive deployment is intended to prevent or mitigate disasters or emergencies, rather than merely responding after they occur.

For example, National Guard units are frequently activated in advance of hurricanes to prepare and to be ready for immediate response after the storm hits. Similarly, they may be deployed before anticipated protests or large gatherings to ensure public safety and order.

Therefore, the statement is mostly false because it overlooks the preventative and preparatory roles that the National Guard often plays in various situations."
1,False,"The statement that on January 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol protestors carried no weapons is factually incorrect. Evidence from the events of that day, including police reports, court documents, and media coverage, indicates that various weapons were indeed present and used by some of the rioters who stormed the Capitol. According to official sources, including the U.S. Department of Justice, individuals involved in the riot were found to have carried and used items such as firearms, pipe bombs, stun guns, and other improvised weapons. Additionally, many were equipped with tactical gear and chemical irritants. This information directly contradicts the claim that the protestors carried no weapons, thus rendering the statement false."
2,Unverifiable,"The statement ""Not even one rocket (from Iran) hit Israel"" is difficult to verify without specific contextual information such as the time period being referred to or the source of the claim. Historical and ongoing geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel, including various proxy conflicts and reported incidents, suggest that there have been indirect confrontations involving rocket fire, often linked to groups supported by Iran, like Hezbollah or other militias. However, direct rocket attacks from Iran to Israel are not commonly reported in reliable sources. Without additional details or evidence directly supporting or refuting the claim that no Iranian rocket has hit Israel, this statement remains unverifiable."
3,False,"The claim that ""326,000 migrants were flown to Florida with taxpayer dollars under President Joe Biden’s secret migrant flight program"" lacks credible evidence and is not supported by any official data or reports. The U.S. government does engage in the transportation of migrants as part of its immigration enforcement activities, which can include flights to various locations for processing or deportation. However, the specific number (326,000), the targeted location (Florida), and the characterization of these operations as a ""secret migrant flight program"" under President Biden are not substantiated by any reliable sources.

Furthermore, the use of the term ""secret"" suggests a lack of transparency that is misleading. While the logistics and details of migrant transportation might not always be widely publicized, such operations are a standard part of the functions of agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and are subject to oversight and regulation.

Without verifiable evidence or official confirmation of the specifics mentioned in the statement, it is prudent to classify the claim as false."
4,False,"The statement claims that crime in Venezuela has decreased by 67% because the country is transferring its criminals and gang members to the United States. This statement can be analyzed in two parts: the claim about the reduction in crime and the reason provided for this reduction.

1. **Reduction in Crime**: There is no reliable, publicly available data that confirms a 67% reduction in crime rates in Venezuela. Crime statistics in Venezuela have been notoriously difficult to verify due to a lack of transparency and reporting inconsistencies. Various reports suggest that Venezuela has high crime rates, particularly in terms of violent crimes such as homicide.

2. **Transferring Criminals to the U.S.**: The claim that Venezuela is systematically sending its criminals to the U.S. lacks evidence and is not supported by any credible reports or data. While individuals from various countries, including Venezuela, do migrate to the United States, there is no evidence to suggest a state-sponsored program aimed at sending criminals to the U.S. This part of the statement seems to be an exaggeration or misinformation.

Given the lack of evidence for both the specific reduction in crime and the alleged method of reducing crime, the statement is rated as false."
5,Mostly False,"The statement claims that in New York, there are no barriers for law enforcement to work with the federal government on immigration laws, and that there are 100 specific crimes where migrants can be handed over. This statement is partially accurate but misleading in its generality and specificity.

Firstly, while New York law enforcement can cooperate with federal immigration authorities, there are certain policies and laws that regulate and sometimes restrict this cooperation. For example, New York City has specific sanctuary city policies that limit the extent to which local law enforcement can cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). These policies generally prohibit city employees, including police officers, from sharing information about immigrants with federal immigration authorities unless required by law or a court order.

Secondly, the claim about ""100 crimes where migrants can be handed over"" simplifies and potentially misrepresents the actual legal framework. While there might be specific statutes or conditions under which migrants who commit crimes can be handed over to federal authorities, stating a specific number such as ""100"" without context or citation is misleading. The actual process of handing over individuals to federal authorities depends on the nature of the crime, the individual's immigration status, and existing local and state policies, which can vary widely.

Therefore, the statement is mostly false because it oversimplifies and misrepresents the complexities of cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities in New York."
6,Mostly True,"The statement about the average salary in the semiconductor industry being $110,000 is generally accurate, aligning with data from various industry sources. For instance, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and other salary aggregation sites often report high average salaries in the semiconductor industry, reflecting the specialized skills and technical knowledge required in this field. However, the claim that one does not need a college degree to earn such a salary in the semiconductor industry is more nuanced. While it is true that there are positions within the industry that might not require a college degree, many of the higher-paying roles typically require specialized education and training, often at the college level or higher. Therefore, while the salary figure is accurate, the implication that high salaries are widely accessible without higher education is somewhat misleading, making the overall statement ""Mostly True."""
7,True,"The statement is accurate and aligns with the provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act signed into law in August 2022. One of the key features of this legislation is the introduction of a cap on out-of-pocket spending for Medicare Part D enrollees. Starting in 2025, the law will indeed cap annual out-of-pocket spending on prescription drugs at $2,000 for individuals enrolled in Medicare Part D. This cap is specifically designed to alleviate the financial burden on seniors, particularly those requiring expensive medications, such as certain cancer treatments which can cost tens of thousands of dollars per year. Therefore, the statement is factual and reflects the changes implemented by the Inflation Reduction Act regarding Medicare Part D."
8,Unverifiable,"The statement claims a specific number of job losses and gains in the auto industry during the presidencies of Donald Trump and Joe Biden, respectively. To verify this statement, we would need access to reliable employment data from the automotive sector over these specific time periods.

1. **Job Losses During Trump's Presidency**: The claim about tens of thousands of auto jobs lost nationwide during Trump's presidency requires examination of employment data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics or similar sources. The auto industry can be influenced by a variety of factors including economic policies, tariffs, global supply chain issues, and market demand. Without specific data or a credible source confirming the exact number of job losses directly related to Trump's policies or during his term, this part of the statement remains unverifiable.

2. **Job Gains During Biden's Presidency**: Similarly, the claim of creating more than 250,000 auto jobs during Biden's presidency also needs validation through employment statistics specifically for the auto industry during his term. Factors such as economic recovery post-pandemic, legislative changes, and industry-specific developments would need to be considered to directly attribute these job gains to Biden's presidency.

Given the lack of specific data provided in the statement and the complexity of attributing job changes directly to presidential policies without thorough economic analysis, the statement is classified as unverifiable."
9,Unverifiable,"The statement ""The current Congress is 'the least productive in our lifetime'"" is difficult to verify without specific metrics of productivity and a defined time frame for ""our lifetime."" Productivity in Congress can be measured in various ways, including the number of bills passed, the significance of the legislation, or other legislative achievements. Additionally, ""our lifetime"" is a subjective measure as it varies from person to person. Without clear criteria and specific data, it is not possible to definitively classify this statement as true or false. Therefore, the statement is unverifiable based on the information provided."
10,Unverifiable,"The statement claims that a video exists showing New York Governor Kathy Hochul being denied entry into the wake for slain NYPD officer Jonathan Diller. To verify this statement, one would need to locate and review the video in question. Additionally, confirming the identities of the individuals involved (Governor Hochul and the event related to officer Jonathan Diller) and the context of the event would be necessary. Without access to the video or further corroborating reports from reliable sources that describe the incident, it is impossible to determine the truthfulness of the statement. Therefore, based on the lack of available evidence and specific details, the claim remains unverifiable."
11,Unverifiable,"The statement claims that there have been 12 elections in Wisconsin within a 24-year period decided by less than 30,000 votes. To verify this statement, one would need access to detailed historical election data for Wisconsin covering the specified time frame. This data would need to include the vote margins for all relevant elections (likely federal, state, and possibly local) to accurately count how many fit the criteria of being decided by less than 30,000 votes.

Without specific references to the elections in question or a reliable source that confirms this statistic, it is not possible to definitively verify the truthfulness of the statement. Additionally, the statement does not specify the types of elections (e.g., presidential, gubernatorial, congressional, etc.), which adds to the difficulty in verifying it. Therefore, due to the lack of detailed information and specific data, the statement must be classified as unverifiable."
12,Unverifiable,"The statement claims that after a 2022 law, the vast majority of colleges in New York State do not have on-campus poll sites. To verify this statement, we would need specific data on the number of colleges in New York State that have established on-campus polling sites following the enactment of the 2022 law. This data would include the total number of colleges in the state and the number of those colleges that have or do not have on-campus polling sites.

Without access to comprehensive and current data on the implementation of the 2022 law across all colleges in New York State, it is not possible to confirm the truthfulness of the statement. Additionally, the statement does not specify which law it is referring to, making it difficult to research any specific provisions or impacts of the law related to on-campus polling sites.

Given the lack of specific data and details provided in the statement, and following the reasoning criteria to err on the side of caution when information is insufficient, the verdict on this statement must be ""Unverifiable."""
13,Mostly True,"The statement refers to a significant reduction in the cost of insulin for Medicare beneficiaries, from an average of $400 a month to $35 a month. This change is largely accurate and aligns with recent U.S. policy changes. The Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law in August 2022, includes provisions that cap the cost of insulin for Medicare beneficiaries at $35 per month starting in 2023. This policy was implemented to make insulin more affordable for millions of Americans who rely on it.

However, the claim that insulin ""was costing 400 bucks a month on average"" before this change might not be precise for every individual, as the cost of insulin could vary widely depending on the type of insulin, dosage, and insurance coverage specifics. Some might have paid more or less than this average. Therefore, while the general reduction to $35 is accurate, the exact figure of $400 as an average might be slightly less precise across all cases. Hence, the verdict is ""Mostly True."""
14,Unverifiable,"The statement “Support for Roe is higher today in America than it has ever been” is difficult to verify without specific polling data or research studies directly comparing current levels of support to historical levels. The statement implies a comparison over time, which requires longitudinal data. While there are polls that measure public opinion on Roe v. Wade at various points in time, without access to comprehensive and consistent data across the entire period since the decision was made in 1973, it is challenging to definitively confirm whether support is at its highest point ever. Additionally, public opinion can fluctuate based on many factors including political, social, and legislative changes. Therefore, without specific evidence or data provided in the statement, it is classified as unverifiable."
15,Mostly True,"The statement that the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act ""attracted $640 billion in private companies’ investments"" is mostly true based on available evidence. The CHIPS and Science Act, signed into law in August 2022, aimed to boost the competitiveness of the United States in science and technology, particularly in semiconductor manufacturing. Following the enactment of this legislation, several major companies announced significant investments in semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S.

For instance, Intel announced a $20 billion investment in Ohio for new chip plants, and Micron Technology announced a $40 billion investment plan to boost memory chip production. TSMC and Texas Instruments also announced multi-billion dollar investments. These announcements align with the spirit of the statement, suggesting a substantial private sector response to the incentives provided by the CHIPS and Science Act.

However, the exact figure of $640 billion might not be entirely accurate or may aggregate different types of investments that are not solely a direct result of the CHIPS Act but are influenced by broader market trends and other factors. Therefore, while the statement is largely true in capturing the significant impact of the Act on private investments, the specific dollar amount and the direct attribution might be slightly overstated or simplified. Hence, the verdict is ""Mostly True."""
16,False,"The statement ""It is a fact that Obama created ISIS"" is not supported by historical evidence or credible sources. ISIS, or the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, emerged from the remnants of al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), a group that existed long before Barack Obama's presidency. The transformation of AQI into ISIS was primarily influenced by its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and the power vacuum created by the Syrian civil war and the political instability in Iraq. While U.S. foreign policy decisions, including those during Obama's administration, have been criticized for possibly contributing to the conditions that allowed ISIS to gain power, directly stating that Obama created ISIS is factually incorrect and misleading. Therefore, the statement is false."
17,Unverifiable,"The statement claims that ""millions of Arizonans will soon live under an even more extreme and dangerous abortion ban,"" which implies a change in legislation or regulation that significantly alters the current legal framework regarding abortion in Arizona. To verify this claim, one would need specific details about the new legislation or regulation, including its contents and the scope of its impact.

The statement also asserts that the ban ""fails to protect women even when their health is at risk or in tragic cases of rape or incest."" This part of the claim requires access to the text of the law or regulation to confirm whether such exceptions are indeed not included.

Without specific references to the legislation or credible sources confirming these changes and their implications, it is not possible to accurately verify the truthfulness of the statement. Therefore, the claim remains unverifiable based on the information provided."
18,False,"The statement contains several claims that can be fact-checked against available evidence:

1. **$500 a month in cash to anyone who accepts illegal aliens into your homes**: There is no evidence or official documentation from the state of Michigan or Governor Gretchen Whitmer's office that supports the claim of a program that specifically offers $500 monthly to residents for housing illegal aliens. Government programs that provide financial assistance typically have specific eligibility criteria and are documented publicly.

2. **Calling the program the Newcomer Rental Subsidy**: A search of official state resources, news outlets, and government announcements yields no results for a program under this name. This suggests that the claim about the existence of such a program is fabricated.

3. **Illegal immigrants described as coming from jails, mental institutions, terrorists**: This characterization of illegal immigrants is a sweeping generalization and lacks evidence. It is a common tactic used to stoke fear and prejudice without factual basis.

4. **Funded by federal taxpayer dollars distributed by Joe Biden**: Federal funding for state programs is typically allocated to specific, documented initiatives. There is no evidence of a federally funded program fitting the description given in the statement.

5. **Biden and Whitmer stealing money to give free housing to illegal alien migrants**: This claim is a serious accusation and would require substantial evidence to be considered true. There is no documented evidence of any such activity, which would constitute criminal behavior.

Overall, the statement appears to be designed to provoke a negative emotional response against specific political figures and immigrants, using unsupported claims and fearmongering language. The lack of evidence for any of the specific claims made in the statement leads to the conclusion that it is false."
19,Mostly False,"The statement contains two main claims: 1) Rep. Adam Schiff voted to send $100 billion to foreign countries, and 2) the U.S. has a $35 trillion national debt. 

For the first claim, without specific details about the legislation referred to, it's challenging to verify the exact amount of $100 billion sent to foreign countries solely based on this statement. U.S. foreign aid budgets are typically a fraction of the total federal budget, and while large sums are indeed allocated to foreign aid, they rarely reach as high as $100 billion in a single legislative act. This figure may be exaggerated or taken out of context (e.g., it might include funds for international programs that are not direct aid).

For the second claim, as of the latest data available in 2023, the U.S. national debt is indeed around $31 trillion, not $35 trillion. This figure is publicly available and regularly updated by sources such as the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve. The statement slightly exaggerates the amount of national debt.

Given these considerations, the statement is mostly false because it likely exaggerates the amount allocated to foreign countries and inaccurately states the U.S. national debt."
20,Mostly False,"The statement contains two main claims: 1) Donald Trump refused to visit an American cemetery outside of Paris, and 2) he said that the soldiers buried there were ""suckers"" and ""losers."" 

1. The first part of the claim regarding Trump's refusal to visit the cemetery is true. In November 2018, Trump was scheduled to visit the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery near Paris but canceled the visit. The official explanation given by the White House was that the helicopter couldn't fly due to bad weather, and the drive was deemed logistically impractical.

2. The second part of the claim, where Trump allegedly called the soldiers ""suckers"" and ""losers,"" is more controversial. This allegation was first reported by The Atlantic in September 2020, citing anonymous sources. However, this specific quote has not been verified by any on-record sources, and several staff members who were with Trump at the time have publicly denied that he made those remarks. 

Given that the first claim is true but the second claim about the derogatory comments remains unverified and is disputed, the overall statement can be classified as ""Mostly False."" The use of the term ""quote"" in the statement also implies a direct attribution which has not been conclusively proven."
21,Unverifiable,"The statement contains multiple claims, some of which are verifiable, while others are not. The first part of the statement claims that no single safety study can assess the cumulative impact of multiple prescriptions and vaccinations throughout childhood. This is a complex claim that would require specific evidence or references to studies that confirm or deny the ability to assess such cumulative impacts. The lack of specific evidence provided in the statement makes this claim unverifiable.

The second part of the statement asserts that conditions like autism used to be one in 10,000 and now are one in 22 in California. This claim involves specific statistics that can be checked against epidemiological data. However, the prevalence rates of autism have indeed increased over time, but the exact figures can vary widely depending on the source and the methodology used for diagnosis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides data on autism prevalence, but the specific figures mentioned (one in 10,000 historically and one in 22 currently in California) are not directly corroborated by widely accepted data from the CDC or other reputable health organizations. The historical rate of one in 10,000 is not a commonly cited figure in reputable sources, and while rates of autism have increased, attributing this solely to pharmaceutical interventions without evidence is speculative.

Therefore, due to the lack of specific evidence and the complexity of the claims made, the overall statement is classified as unverifiable."
22,Mostly True,"During his 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump made several statements that suggested he might not automatically defend NATO allies if they were attacked by Russia. Specifically, in an interview with The New York Times in July 2016, Trump was asked about whether he would provide military aid to the Baltic states if Russia attacked them. He indicated that he would decide whether to come to their aid only after reviewing if those nations have ""fulfilled their obligations to us."" This statement implies a conditional commitment to NATO's principle of collective defense, as outlined in Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which states that an attack on one member is considered an attack on all members.

However, it's important to note that Trump did not explicitly say he ""would not"" defend NATO allies, but rather that his decision would depend on the allies' contributions to the alliance. Therefore, the statement is mostly true, as it captures the essence of Trump's position, albeit with some nuance missing regarding the conditionality of his support."
23,False,"The claim that George Soros was paying students to organize protests is a common conspiracy theory that lacks credible evidence. This assertion has been widely circulated on social media and various websites, often in the context of various protests around the world, including those in the United States. Fact-checking organizations such as Snopes, PolitiFact, and FactCheck.org have investigated similar claims and found them to be unsubstantiated. These investigations typically reveal that while Soros, through his foundations, has donated to groups that support democracy and human rights, there is no direct evidence linking him to paying protesters or specifically organizing protests. The narrative tends to exploit Soros's involvement in philanthropy to make unfounded leaps about his personal involvement in protest activities. Thus, based on the lack of credible evidence supporting the claim and the findings from reputable fact-checking sources, the statement is classified as false."
24,False,"There is no credible evidence or record of President Donald Trump stating to TIME Magazine or any other reputable source that he would ""force every pregnant woman to submit to constant government monitoring"" in his second term. This claim is highly specific and, if true, would likely have been widely reported and discussed in major media outlets due to its controversial nature. A search of TIME Magazine's archives and other reliable news sources does not yield any results supporting this statement. Additionally, such a policy proposal would be a significant deviation from known political positions and actions taken during Trump's presidency regarding health policy and women's rights. Therefore, the statement is false."
25,True,"Joe Biden's academic performance at Syracuse University College of Law has been publicly acknowledged and documented. Biden himself has admitted to graduating near the bottom of his class. Specifically, he graduated 76th in a class of 85 from the law school in 1968. This information has been confirmed by multiple reliable sources, including news outlets and Biden's own speeches where he has discussed his academic record. Therefore, the statement is factual and can be classified as ""True."""
26,Mostly True,"The statement claims that only two U.S. presidents, Herbert Hoover and Donald Trump, left office with fewer jobs in the country than when they entered. To verify this, we need to look at employment data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics or similar reliable sources.

1. Herbert Hoover was president from 1929 to 1933, a period that coincides with the onset of the Great Depression. During his presidency, the U.S. economy suffered a massive downturn, and unemployment rates soared. It is well-documented that the number of jobs decreased significantly during Hoover's term.

2. Donald Trump was president from January 2017 to January 2021. His term was marked by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to substantial job losses. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment in the U.S. was higher in January 2017 than in January 2021, indicating a net job loss during Trump's presidency.

While these cases support the statement, the claim that these are the ""only"" two presidents under whom this occurred needs scrutiny. Other presidents have presided over economic downturns, but a detailed historical analysis would be required to confirm absolutely that no other presidents meet these criteria. However, based on available evidence and prominent economic downturns coinciding with presidential terms, the statement is mostly true but not absolute without further detailed historical economic analysis of each presidency."
27,Unverifiable,"The statement claims that the top donor to a major super PAC supporting Donald Trump for president in 2024 is also the top donor to the super PAC supporting Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for president. To verify this statement, one would need access to up-to-date and comprehensive campaign finance data for both super PACs mentioned. This data includes the identities of donors and the amounts they have contributed, which can fluctuate over time as new contributions are made.

As of the last update, there is no widely available or reliable source that confirms the identities of the top donors to these specific super PACs for the 2024 presidential election cycle. Campaign finance data is typically reported to regulatory bodies like the Federal Election Commission (FEC) in the United States, and while this data is public, it requires analysis to determine top donors, which might not yet be fully compiled or analyzed for the current election cycle.

Furthermore, without specific names of the super PACs or more detailed information, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the claim. Therefore, due to the lack of specific, verifiable information and the dynamic nature of campaign finance, this statement must be classified as unverifiable."
28,Unverifiable,"The statement in question is a prediction about future events contingent on the speaker not being elected. Predictions, especially those concerning complex social or political outcomes, are inherently speculative and cannot be verified until the events they describe have either occurred or failed to occur. Furthermore, the use of the term ""bloodbath"" is likely metaphorical and subjective, indicating severe consequences but not necessarily literal violence. Without specific evidence or a clear, measurable criterion for what constitutes a ""bloodbath for the country,"" this statement remains a personal opinion or a rhetorical expression rather than a verifiable fact. Thus, it is classified as unverifiable."
29,False,"The statement that ""U.S. President Joe Biden is the first president to skip a cognitive test during an annual physical exam"" is false. It is important to note that cognitive tests are not a standard or routine part of a presidential physical exam. The tradition of presidents publicly releasing the results of their physical exams does not typically include cognitive testing unless specifically requested or deemed necessary. For example, President Donald Trump voluntarily took a cognitive test during his presidency, but this was not a standard practice for all presidents before him. There is no established precedent or requirement for U.S. presidents to undergo cognitive testing during their physical exams. Therefore, the claim that Joe Biden is the first to skip such a test implies a standard practice that does not exist."
30,Unverifiable,"The statement claims that Nikki Haley lost the Nevada presidential primary to ""None of These Candidates"" in February 2024. As of the last update in 2023, February 2024 has not yet occurred, making it impossible to verify the truth of this statement. Additionally, while Nevada does have a unique option on its ballots allowing voters to select ""None of These Candidates,"" the claim about a specific event happening in the future cannot be fact-checked with current information. Therefore, the statement is unverifiable."
31,False,"The statement claims that Joe Biden is the only presidential candidate to win a primary election as a write-in candidate. This is factually incorrect. While Joe Biden has won primary elections, there is no record of him winning any as a write-in candidate. Moreover, he is not the only presidential candidate to have won a primary as a write-in candidate. A notable example is Senator Lisa Murkowski from Alaska, who won a general election as a write-in candidate in 2010, although this was for the Senate and not the presidency. For presidential primaries, there have been instances where candidates have received significant write-in votes, but these are rare and none specifically match the claim about Biden. Therefore, the statement is false."
32,False,"Donald Trump won the New Hampshire Republican primary in 2016 and 2020. However, he did not win the New Hampshire primary in any other election year. The statement claims that Trump won the New Hampshire primary three times, which is factually incorrect. Therefore, the statement is false."
33,Unverifiable,"The statement claims that Donald Trump's margin of victory in the 2024 Republican Iowa caucuses was the smallest of any GOP candidate in history. As of my last update in 2023, the 2024 Iowa caucuses have not yet occurred, making it impossible to verify any claims about the results or margins of victory in that event. Therefore, the statement is unverifiable based on the information available up to 2023."
34,Unverifiable,"The statement claims that U.S. Republican 2024 presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy received money from billionaire George Soros. To verify this statement, one would need to look at credible sources such as campaign finance reports, credible news reports, or direct statements from either Ramaswamy or Soros confirming the transaction. Without specific evidence or sources cited in the statement, it is not possible to confirm the truthfulness of the claim. Additionally, political donations and affiliations are often publicly recorded and scrutinized, but without direct evidence or further information, this statement remains unverifiable."
35,False,"The statement contains two parts: one about individuals possibly canceling or rethinking summer trips due to high prices, and another claiming that taxpayer dollars are used to pay for illegal immigrants to fly into towns. The first part of the statement is plausible as it reflects a common concern about travel costs, which can fluctuate due to various economic factors including inflation, fuel prices, etc. However, it is the second part of the statement that requires scrutiny for its truthfulness.

The claim that taxpayer dollars are used to pay for illegal immigrants to fly into various towns is a common misconception and is often used in political rhetoric. In the United States, for example, while the government does have provisions under certain circumstances to transport immigrants, this is typically done for those who are under legal processes such as asylum seekers or refugees, and not indiscriminately for ""illegal immigrants"" as suggested by the statement. Moreover, such movements are part of structured immigration enforcement and processing, not random or widespread as implied.

Additionally, the use of the term ""illegal immigrants"" is often associated with those who have entered a country without legal permission and are in violation of immigration laws. The U.S. government's policies and actions regarding the transportation of such individuals usually involve deportation to their country of origin rather than domestic flights to various towns.

Therefore, the statement misrepresents the nature and purpose of government actions regarding immigrants and uses a misleading narrative, making it false."
36,False,"The statement contains several claims that need to be evaluated for their truthfulness and plausibility:

1. **Claim that Democrats are ""killing Social Security and Medicare by allowing the invasion of migrants""**: There is no evidence to support the claim that Democrats are intentionally harming Social Security and Medicare through immigration policies. Social Security and Medicare are funded primarily through payroll taxes and managed by the federal government. Immigration can impact these programs in various ways, but the assertion that Democrats are actively ""killing"" these programs through policies that allow immigration is not supported by factual evidence.

2. **Use of the term ""invasion"" to describe migration**: The term ""invasion"" is a highly charged and misleading description when referring to migration. Migration policies and their impacts are complex, but using the term ""invasion"" suggests a hostile, military-like scenario that does not accurately represent the nature of migration.

3. **Claim about the impact of Biden's policies on Social Security, Medicare, and the country**: The statement asserts that President Biden's policies are destroying Social Security, Medicare, and the country. This is a broad and sweeping claim that lacks specific evidence. Policy impacts can be debated and analyzed, but the claim as stated is overly simplistic and does not provide a factual basis for such severe conclusions.

4. **Promise not to touch Social Security and Medicare**: While this part of the statement reflects a policy position rather than a factual claim, it's important to note that any changes to Social Security and Medicare would typically involve Congress and cannot be unilaterally guaranteed by a president.

Overall, the statement is highly partisan and uses exaggerated and misleading language to describe complex policy issues. The claims made are not supported by evidence and are designed to provoke emotional rather than rational responses. Thus, the verdict is ""False."""
37,Unverifiable,"The statement contains multiple claims, some of which are verifiable, while others are not. The claim about President Biden inviting a border crisis with 94 executive actions in his first 100 days is specific and can be fact-checked. However, a comprehensive list of all executive actions taken by President Biden in his first 100 days does not specifically indicate that all these actions were directly related to immigration or border policy. Many of these actions covered a wide range of topics including COVID-19 response, climate change, and racial equity. Therefore, the claim that all 94 actions invited a border crisis is an exaggeration and lacks specificity in how they directly relate to causing a border crisis.

The anecdote shared about the woman who was sex trafficked is deeply troubling but is presented without verifiable details that can confirm its accuracy or directly link it to Biden's border policies. Personal testimonies in such contexts are challenging to verify independently without additional corroborating evidence or details.

Lastly, the statement that ""President Biden’s border policies are a disgrace"" is a subjective opinion and cannot be fact-checked as true or false because it reflects a personal or political judgment rather than an objective fact.

Given these considerations, the overall statement is classified as ""Unverifiable"" because while some elements can be fact-checked, the key claims and the anecdotal evidence lack sufficient verifiability and are mixed with subjective opinions."
38,Unverifiable,"The statement provided involves a specific claim about a military and diplomatic interaction between Iran and the United States, including details about communication and actions taken by both sides. To verify this statement, one would need access to detailed military and diplomatic records or credible reports from reliable sources that confirm the sequence of events as described. Without such information, it is not possible to confirm the truthfulness of the claim that Iran intentionally informed the U.S. about a planned but deliberately missed strike on a military base. This scenario involves sensitive and potentially classified interactions, which are not typically disclosed in full detail to the public. Therefore, due to the lack of publicly available evidence to either confirm or refute the claim, the statement must be classified as unverifiable."
39,Mostly True,"The statement contains several claims that need to be evaluated individually:

1. ""You know how many billionaires we have in America today? One thousand."" - As of various reports and sources like Forbes, the number of billionaires in the United States is indeed around this figure, though it can fluctuate slightly above or below one thousand due to market conditions and other factors.

2. ""You know what their average rate — tax rate — federal tax rate is? Federal tax rate is 8.5 percent."" - This claim is supported by some studies and reports, including a notable analysis by ProPublica in 2021, which revealed that the wealthiest Americans can pay a significantly lower effective federal tax rate than the average citizen, sometimes even as low as single digits. However, the exact figure can vary depending on the source and the specific group of billionaires analyzed.

3. ""There’d be $40 billion raised if they even pay 25 percent."" - This claim involves a calculation that depends on the total income of these billionaires and the difference in the tax rate from 8.5% to 25%. While the exact figure could vary, the general assertion that increasing the tax rate to 25% would raise a significant amount of revenue is plausible based on the high total wealth of billionaires.

Overall, the statement is ""Mostly True"" because the claims are generally supported by available data, though there might be slight variations in the specific figures mentioned."
40,Unverifiable,"The statement provided lacks specific data and context that would allow for a factual verification. The claim of having ""the best unemployment rates ever"" is vague without a defined time period or a specific unemployment rate figure to compare against historical data. Additionally, the assertion that current unemployment rates are calculated differently or are ""a whole different thing"" is not substantiated with evidence or a clear explanation of how the methodologies differ, if at all. Unemployment rates are typically calculated based on standardized methods by agencies such as the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which have not fundamentally changed their methodology in a way described by the statement. Without specific details or evidence, the claim remains unverifiable."
41,Unverifiable,"The statement claims that House Republicans took numerous votes that would have damaged economic growth and harmed national security, specifically mentioning an attempt to eliminate over 2,000 Border Patrol agents. To verify this statement, we would need specific instances of votes that clearly aimed to damage economic growth and harm national security, along with evidence of a specific vote or proposal to eliminate over 2,000 Border Patrol agents.

Without specific bills, dates, or contexts provided in the statement, it is challenging to fact-check the accuracy of these claims. The statement may be based on interpretations or opinions regarding the potential effects of certain votes rather than direct evidence. Additionally, the impact of such votes on economic growth and national security can be subjective and would require expert analysis to substantiate.

Therefore, due to the lack of detailed information and the inability to access specific legislative records or expert analyses directly linked to the claims, this statement is classified as unverifiable."
42,Unverifiable,"The statement contains two parts: one about not selling land to the Chinese, and another about recruiting a fiberglass company. To verify the truthfulness of this statement, specific details such as the identity of the speaker, the context in which the statement was made, and relevant factual data about land sales and business recruitment activities are required. Without access to this information or additional context, it is impossible to determine the accuracy of either claim. Therefore, the statement must be classified as unverifiable."
43,False,"The statement claims that ""more people are dying of bad climate change policies than they are of actual climate change,"" which is not supported by evidence and is misleading. Climate change, as a scientific consensus, is a significant global issue caused by human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases. It leads to severe weather events (like hurricanes, heatwaves, and floods), rising sea levels, and other environmental impacts that pose direct and indirect threats to human life.

The assertion that climate change policies are causing more deaths than climate change itself lacks substantiation. While it is true that some policies may have unintended negative consequences, the primary intent of climate change policies globally is to mitigate the effects of climate change and reduce the long-term risks it poses to human civilization, including death and displacement from extreme weather events, food and water scarcity, and loss of biodiversity.

Moreover, numerous studies and reports from organizations such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) highlight the adverse effects of climate change on human health and mortality. These effects are expected to worsen without significant efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to unavoidable climate impacts.

Therefore, the statement is false as it contradicts the broad scientific understanding and evidence regarding the impacts of climate change and the general objectives of climate change policies."
44,Unverifiable,"The statement contains two distinct parts. The first part concerns the presence of ""biological boys"" in girls' locker rooms, which refers to a contentious issue related to transgender rights and access to gender-specific spaces. Whether or not this is happening depends on specific local or institutional policies and is not universally applicable or verifiable without more context.

The second part of the statement claims that ""a third of our teenage girls seriously contemplated suicide last year."" This statistic, while specific, lacks a source or context in the statement. According to data from the CDC, in 2019, about 25% of female high school students reported considering suicide, which is significant but not exactly one-third. However, the statement does not specify a time frame or a geographic location (such as a specific country), making it difficult to verify the accuracy of ""last year"" in this context.

Overall, without additional context or sources, both parts of the statement are difficult to verify for accuracy and truthfulness, leading to the classification as unverifiable."
45,Unverifiable,"The statement ""China’s eyes and ears — dangerously close, too dangerous to lead"" is highly subjective and lacks specific context or details that would allow for a factual verification. The phrase ""China's eyes and ears"" metaphorically suggests surveillance or influence, but without additional information, it's unclear what specific aspect or scenario this is referring to. The terms ""dangerously close"" and ""too dangerous to lead"" are also vague and subjective, implying a judgment or opinion rather than a verifiable fact. Without concrete evidence or a clear reference to specific events, policies, or actions, this statement remains unverifiable."
46,Unverifiable,"The statement ""Hundreds of people on our terrorist watch list are crossing our borders"" lacks specific details and context that would allow for a thorough verification. Key missing information includes the specific time frame during which these crossings allegedly occurred, the specific borders referenced (whether they are land, air, or sea borders), and the source of the data that claims hundreds on the terrorist watch list are crossing. Without this information, it is not possible to confirm the truthfulness or plausibility of the statement. Additionally, the statement does not specify which country's borders are being referred to, which is crucial for verifying such a claim. Therefore, due to the lack of detailed information and the inability to access relevant data sources or evidence, the statement must be classified as unverifiable."
47,Unverifiable,"The statement ""This trial that I have now, that’s a Biden trial"" is ambiguous and lacks specific context or details that would allow for a factual verification. The phrase ""a Biden trial"" could imply that the trial is influenced, initiated, or characterized by actions or policies specific to President Biden or his administration. However, without additional information about the trial in question, such as the nature of the trial, the reasons for attributing it to Biden, or any direct involvement or influence from Biden or his administration, it is impossible to determine the truthfulness or accuracy of the statement. Therefore, the statement is unverifiable based on the information provided."
48,False,"The statement claims that President Biden is the first president in history to use federal agencies to censor political speech and his opponent. This statement is historically inaccurate as there have been documented instances where other U.S. presidents or their administrations have been involved in actions that could be interpreted as attempts to influence or control political speech.

For example, during World War I, President Woodrow Wilson's administration enacted the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918, which were used to suppress dissent and censor publications that were critical of the government's war efforts. More recently, the Nixon administration attempted to stop the publication of the Pentagon Papers, which were classified documents related to the Vietnam War.

While there are debates and criticisms regarding the actions of various administrations, including the Biden administration, in terms of handling information and dealing with social media platforms or news outlets, the claim that President Biden is the ""first"" to use federal agencies in this manner is factually incorrect. Therefore, the statement is false."
49,Mostly True,"The statement lists several major retailers and claims they have had mass store closures during Joe Biden's presidency, which began in January 2021. To verify this, we need to look at each company individually:

1. **Dollar Tree**: In 2021, Dollar Tree announced plans to close hundreds of its Family Dollar stores, though it also planned to open new stores under both the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar banners.

2. **Walgreens**: In 2021, Walgreens announced it would close approximately 200 stores in the United States as part of a cost management program.

3. **Macy’s**: Macy's has been undergoing a restructuring process that included store closures. In January 2021, Macy's announced the closure of 45 stores as part of a plan to close 125 locations by 2023.

4. **Foot Locker**: In March 2021, Foot Locker announced that it planned to close about 10% of its stores over the next two years, which amounts to approximately 240 stores.

5. **Gap**: In October 2020, Gap Inc. announced plans to close 350 Gap and Banana Republic stores in North America by the end of 2023. While this plan was announced before Biden's presidency, the process of closures is ongoing during his term.

6. **Burger King**: There is less clear information about mass closures of Burger King locations specifically during Biden's presidency. However, the fast-food industry has seen various shifts and closures, but not necessarily mass closures directly attributable to the current administration.

7. **Regal Cinemas**: Regal temporarily closed all its U.S. theaters in October 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and began reopening in April 2021. These closures and reopenings are more related to pandemic conditions than directly to presidential policies.

8. **Kroger**: There is no widely reported information about mass store closures of Kroger during Joe Biden’s presidency. Kroger has been seen more in an expansion mode, though some individual stores might have closed due to various reasons like performance or local market conditions.

The statement is ""Mostly True"" because most of the companies listed have indeed experienced significant store closures during Joe Biden's presidency, although the reasons for these closures vary and are not necessarily directly attributable to presidential policies. Some closures were planned before Biden took office and others are influenced by broader economic or pandemic-related factors."
