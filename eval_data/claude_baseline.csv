0,False,"The statement ""The National Guard in the HISTORY of its life, gets called in AFTER a disaster, not BEFORE something happens"" is false. The National Guard can be called in both before and after disasters or emergencies, depending on the situation.

The National Guard is a reserve component of the United States Armed Forces and can be activated by the governor of a state or the President of the United States. One of the primary roles of the National Guard is to assist in emergency response and disaster relief operations.

In many cases, the National Guard is called in before a disaster strikes to assist with preparedness efforts, such as evacuations, sandbagging, and other preventive measures. For example, the National Guard is often activated in advance of hurricanes or severe storms to help with evacuation efforts and to position resources for potential rescue and recovery operations.

Additionally, the National Guard can be called in to provide support during civil unrest, protests, or other situations where additional security or law enforcement assistance is needed. In these cases, the National Guard is deployed proactively to maintain order and prevent potential disasters or emergencies from escalating.

While the National Guard does play a crucial role in disaster response and recovery efforts after emergencies have occurred, it is inaccurate to claim that they are only called in after a disaster has happened. The National Guard's role encompasses both preventive and reactive measures, depending on the specific circumstances and the needs of the state or federal authorities."
1,False,"The statement ""On Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol 'protestors carried no weapons'"" is false based on the evidence and reports from the events of that day. According to multiple news sources and official investigations, many of the rioters who breached the U.S. Capitol building on January 6, 2021, were armed with various weapons, including firearms, baseball bats, bear spray, and other improvised weapons.

The Department of Justice has charged numerous individuals with carrying or using dangerous weapons during the Capitol riot. For example, Christopher Michael Alberts was charged with carrying a Taurus revolver loaded with ammunition on Capitol grounds. Lonnie Coffman, an Alabama man, was arrested with multiple firearms and Molotov cocktails in his vehicle near the Capitol.

Additionally, video footage and photographic evidence from the riot clearly shows rioters wielding various weapons, including baseball bats, flagpoles, and other blunt objects used as weapons against law enforcement officers.

While some protesters may not have carried weapons, the statement that ""protestors carried no weapons"" is demonstrably false based on the overwhelming evidence and charges filed against individuals involved in the Capitol breach."
2,Unverifiable,"The statement ""Not even one rocket (from Iran) hit Israel"" is difficult to verify without additional context or sources. While it is possible that no rockets from Iran directly hit Israel during a specific time period, the statement lacks crucial details such as the timeframe being referred to or the specific conflict or situation being discussed.

Without more information about the context, it is challenging to fact-check this statement accurately. Iran and Israel have had tensions and conflicts over the years, and there have been instances of rocket attacks from various groups, including those supported by Iran, targeting Israel. However, determining whether no rockets from Iran itself hit Israel during a particular event or period would require reliable sources and evidence.

Given the lack of specificity in the statement and the absence of supporting evidence or context, the most appropriate classification is ""Unverifiable."" It is better to err on the side of caution and avoid making assumptions or guesses without sufficient information to substantiate the claim."
3,False,"The statement that ""326,000 migrants were flown to Florida with taxpayer dollars under President Joe Biden's secret migrant flight program"" is false. There is no credible evidence to support this claim.

First, the number of 326,000 migrants being flown to Florida is an extremely high figure that would have been widely reported and documented if it were true. Major news outlets and government agencies have not reported any such large-scale migrant flights to Florida.

Second, the claim of a ""secret migrant flight program"" under President Biden is unsubstantiated. The Biden administration has continued the practice of transporting some migrants within the United States for processing or relocation, but this is not a secret program and is a continuation of policies from previous administrations.

Third, the use of the term ""taxpayer dollars"" is misleading, as the transportation and processing of migrants is a routine part of the operations of federal agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which are funded through the federal budget.

While there have been reports of some migrant flights to Florida and other states, these have been on a much smaller scale and are part of the normal operations of immigration agencies, not a secret program. Without credible evidence or sources to back up the specific claims made in the statement, it is reasonable to conclude that it is false."
4,False,"The statement ""Crime is down in Venezuela by 67% because they're taking their gangs and their criminals and depositing them very nicely into the United States"" is false and lacks credible evidence to support it. There are no reports or data from reputable sources that suggest Venezuela is intentionally sending criminals or gang members to the United States, nor is there any evidence of a 67% decrease in crime rates in Venezuela due to such an action.

This statement appears to be a baseless claim, likely made to promote a particular narrative or agenda. It is important to rely on factual information from credible sources when making claims about crime rates, immigration policies, or any other sensitive topics. Without concrete evidence to back up this statement, it should be considered false."
5,Mostly False,"The statement ""In New York, there are no barriers to law enforcement to work with the federal government on immigration laws, and there are 100 crimes where migrants can be handed over"" is mostly false based on the following analysis:

1. The first part of the statement, ""In New York, there are no barriers to law enforcement to work with the federal government on immigration laws,"" is false. New York has implemented policies that limit cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities. For example, the New York State DREAM Act prohibits state and local law enforcement from inquiring about immigration status during routine interactions, and the New York City Council has passed laws limiting cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer requests.

2. The second part of the statement, ""there are 100 crimes where migrants can be handed over,"" is misleading and lacks context. While there may be a list of specific crimes that could potentially lead to cooperation with immigration authorities, the statement oversimplifies the process and fails to acknowledge the nuances and limitations in place.

It's important to note that the policies surrounding cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities in New York are complex and subject to ongoing legal and political debates. However, based on the available information, the statement appears to be mostly false, as it misrepresents the existing barriers and oversimplifies the process of handing over migrants."
6,Mostly False,"1. The statement claims that the average salary in the semiconductor industry is $110,000 and that a college degree is not required. While it is possible to find jobs in the semiconductor industry without a college degree, the claim about the average salary being $110,000 seems questionable.

2. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the median annual wage for semiconductor processors in May 2021 was $47,150. The BLS data shows that the average salary for this occupation is significantly lower than the claimed $110,000.

3. While some highly skilled or experienced professionals in the semiconductor industry may earn salaries around $110,000 or higher, it is unlikely that this figure represents the average salary across the entire industry, which includes entry-level and mid-level positions.

4. Regarding the claim that a college degree is not needed, while it is possible to find some semiconductor industry jobs without a degree, most positions, especially those involving technical or engineering roles, typically require at least a bachelor's degree in a relevant field, such as electrical engineering, computer science, or physics.

5. Without additional context or sources to support the claimed average salary figure, it is reasonable to classify this statement as ""Mostly False"" based on the available data from authoritative sources like the BLS."
7,Mostly True,"The statement appears to be referring to the changes made to Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The Act introduces a $2,000 out-of-pocket cap on prescription drug costs for Medicare Part D beneficiaries starting in 2025.

The statement correctly highlights that some cancer drugs can cost tens of thousands of dollars per year, which can be a significant financial burden for patients. The $2,000 cap aims to provide relief for Medicare beneficiaries who require expensive medications.

However, the statement could be slightly misleading as it suggests that the $2,000 cap applies to all prescription drugs, regardless of the total cost. In reality, the cap applies to out-of-pocket costs, and beneficiaries may still have to pay a portion of the drug costs until they reach the $2,000 limit.

Additionally, the statement does not mention that the cap is subject to certain conditions, such as being enrolled in a Medicare Part D plan and meeting specific income requirements.

Overall, while the statement captures the essence of the $2,000 out-of-pocket cap for Medicare Part D beneficiaries, it lacks some nuances and details. Therefore, it can be considered ""Mostly True"" based on the available information."
8,Unverifiable,"The statement makes two claims: 1) ""Tens of thousands of auto jobs were lost nationwide during Trump's presidency,"" and 2) ""we've created more than 250,000 auto jobs"" during Biden's presidency. However, the statement does not provide any specific sources or data to support these claims.

Without credible sources or data to verify the job numbers mentioned, it is difficult to determine the truthfulness of these claims. While it is plausible that job losses and gains occurred in the auto industry during the respective presidencies, the exact figures cannot be confirmed based solely on this statement.

To properly verify the claims, we would need to consult official government data, reports from reputable organizations, or statements from authoritative sources that provide factual evidence and statistics on auto industry employment during the relevant time periods.

In the absence of such supporting evidence, the most appropriate verdict for this statement is ""Unverifiable."" It is essential to rely on credible sources and data when making factual claims, especially regarding specific numerical figures. Without proper citations or references, it is prudent to refrain from blindly accepting or rejecting the statement."
9,Unverifiable,"The statement ""The current Congress is 'the least productive in our lifetime'"" is too vague and subjective to be definitively verified or classified as true or false. There are a few issues with this statement:

1. The term ""least productive"" is not clearly defined or quantified. Productivity in Congress can be measured in various ways, such as the number of bills passed, the significance of the legislation, or the impact on the country. Without a specific metric or criteria for productivity, the statement becomes ambiguous and open to interpretation.

2. The phrase ""in our lifetime"" is also vague and relative. It depends on the age and lifespan of the person making the statement, which is not provided. Different individuals may have different lifetimes, making the comparison subjective.

3. There is no citation or evidence provided to support the claim that the current Congress is the least productive compared to previous Congresses within a specific timeframe or based on specific metrics.

To verify or refute this statement, we would need more specific information, such as:

- A clear definition of what constitutes ""productivity"" in Congress (e.g., number of bills passed, significant legislation enacted, impact on the economy or society, etc.).
- A specific timeframe or range of Congresses to compare against (e.g., the least productive in the last 50 years, since World War II, etc.).
- Quantitative data or analysis comparing the productivity of the current Congress to previous Congresses based on the defined metrics.
- Reliable sources or citations from reputable organizations or experts to support the claim.

Without this additional information and evidence, it is impossible to definitively classify the statement as true or false. Therefore, the most appropriate verdict is ""Unverifiable"" based on the reasoning criteria provided."
10,Unverifiable,"Based on the information provided in the statement, it is difficult to verify the truthfulness of the claim that a video shows New York Governor Kathy Hochul being denied entry into the wake for slain NYPD officer Jonathan Diller. Without access to the alleged video or additional context, it is impossible to confirm or refute this claim with certainty.

The statement itself does not provide enough evidence or details to determine its plausibility or truthfulness. It simply asserts the existence of a video depicting a specific incident, but no further information is given to corroborate or refute this claim.

In such cases where there is a lack of sufficient information or evidence, it is prudent to err on the side of caution and classify the statement as ""Unverifiable"" rather than making blind guesses or assumptions. Without access to the purported video or additional credible sources to verify the claim, it is impossible to determine the truthfulness of the statement with confidence."
11,Unverifiable,"The statement ""We've had 12 elections in 24 years in Wisconsin that have been decided by less than 30,000 votes"" lacks sufficient context and evidence to verify its truthfulness. Without additional information about the specific elections being referred to, the time period covered, and the sources of the vote count data, it is impossible to determine the accuracy of the claim.

While it is plausible that some elections in Wisconsin could have been decided by narrow margins, the statement's broad generalization and lack of specificity make it difficult to fact-check. Elections can vary significantly in terms of voter turnout, the number of contested races, and the distribution of votes across different regions or demographics.

To properly verify this statement, we would need access to official election results from a reputable source, such as the Wisconsin Elections Commission or other authoritative bodies. These sources should provide detailed information on the vote counts for each election, the margins of victory, and any relevant historical context or analysis.

Without access to such evidence, it would be irresponsible to label the statement as true or false. The most appropriate verdict, in this case, is ""Unverifiable"" due to the lack of sufficient information to substantiate or refute the claim."
12,Unverifiable,"The statement ""The vast majority of colleges in New York State do not have on-campus poll sites"" is difficult to verify without access to comprehensive data on the number of colleges in New York State and the presence or absence of on-campus poll sites in each of them. The statement does not provide any specific sources or evidence to support the claim.

While it is possible that a law passed in 2022 may have impacted the availability of on-campus poll sites in New York colleges, the statement itself does not provide enough information to determine the truthfulness or falsity of the claim. Without access to reliable data or sources, it would be speculative to classify the statement as true, mostly true, half true, mostly false, or false.

Given the lack of supporting evidence and the broad nature of the claim, the most appropriate verdict is ""Unverifiable."" It is essential to err on the side of caution and avoid blind guessing when there is insufficient information to verify a statement accurately."
13,Mostly True,"The statement appears to be mostly true based on the information provided by the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. The IRA includes provisions to cap the out-of-pocket cost for insulin at $35 per month for Medicare beneficiaries starting in 2023.

According to a report by the Kaiser Family Foundation, the average out-of-pocket cost for insulin for Medicare beneficiaries without low-income subsidies was around $572 per year or $47.67 per month in 2020. However, for those with low-income subsidies, the average cost was around $92 per year or $7.67 per month.

While the statement does not provide the exact pre-IRA cost figure of $400 per month, it is plausible that some Medicare beneficiaries were paying that amount or more, especially those without low-income subsidies or with high-deductible plans.

Therefore, the statement can be considered mostly true, as the IRA has significantly reduced the out-of-pocket cost for insulin for Medicare beneficiaries, although the exact pre-IRA cost may vary depending on individual circumstances."
14,Mostly False,"The statement ""Support for Roe is higher today in America than it has ever been"" is mostly false based on the available data and evidence.

According to a poll conducted by the Pew Research Center in May 2022, after the leaked draft opinion suggesting the Supreme Court might overturn Roe v. Wade, 61% of U.S. adults said they believed abortion should be legal in all or most cases. This figure is higher than some previous years, but it is not the highest level of support for legal abortion in the United States.

Historical data from Gallup polls show that support for legal abortion reached its peak in the mid-1990s, with 66% of Americans believing abortion should be legal in certain circumstances in 1996. Additionally, a CBS News/New York Times poll conducted in 1992 found that 64% of Americans believed abortion should be permitted.

Therefore, while support for legal abortion has increased in recent years, it is not accurate to say that it is higher today than it has ever been in the United States. The statement is mostly false, as there have been periods in the past when support for legal abortion was higher than current levels.

It's important to note that public opinion on abortion is complex and can fluctuate over time, influenced by various factors such as political climate, legal developments, and societal attitudes. However, based on the available polling data, the statement in question appears to be an overstatement of the current level of support for legal abortion compared to historical levels."
15,False,"The statement that the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act ""attracted $640 billion in private companies' investments"" is false. According to multiple reputable sources, the claim of $640 billion in private investments being attracted due to the CHIPS Act is inaccurate and misleading.

The CHIPS and Science Act, officially known as the ""Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act of 2022,"" is a legislation aimed at boosting domestic semiconductor manufacturing and research in the United States. However, the $640 billion figure cited in the statement does not refer to actual investments made by private companies as a result of the Act.

According to a fact-check by Reuters, the $640 billion figure was mentioned by U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo during a press briefing, but it referred to the potential investment that could be unlocked by the CHIPS Act over the next decade, not actual investments already made. Raimondo's statement was a projection or estimate, not a factual claim about investments already attracted.

Furthermore, the Associated Press (AP) also fact-checked this claim and rated it as false. The AP report states that the $640 billion figure is an estimate of potential private-sector investment over the next 10 years, contingent on the CHIPS Act's implementation and other factors.

Since the statement presents the $640 billion figure as actual investments already attracted by the CHIPS Act, which is not the case according to authoritative sources, the verdict is False."
16,False,"The statement ""It is a fact that Obama created ISIS"" is false. ISIS, or the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, is a Sunni jihadist group that emerged in the early 2000s from the remnants of al-Qaeda in Iraq. The group gained significant power and territory in Iraq and Syria during the Syrian Civil War and the Iraqi insurgency, but it was not created by former U.S. President Barack Obama.

ISIS can trace its roots back to the Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who founded al-Qaeda in Iraq, the precursor to ISIS, in 2004. The group initially aimed to expel U.S. forces from Iraq and topple the Iraqi government. After al-Zarqawi's death in 2006, the group rebranded itself as the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) and continued its insurgency against U.S. and Iraqi forces.

In 2011, during the Syrian Civil War, the group expanded its operations into Syria and changed its name to the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS or ISIL). The group exploited the chaos and power vacuum in Syria to gain control over large swaths of territory and resources.

While some critics have argued that the Obama administration's policies in Iraq and Syria contributed to the rise of ISIS, there is no credible evidence to suggest that Obama or his administration directly created or founded the terrorist organization. The claim that Obama created ISIS is widely considered a false conspiracy theory and has been debunked by numerous fact-checking organizations and experts on the subject."
17,Mostly True,"The statement appears to be referring to the recent ruling by a Pima County Superior Court judge that allowed Arizona's near-total abortion ban from 1901 to take effect. This law, which predates statehood, prohibits abortion in all cases except when the life of the mother is in danger.

The statement is mostly true because:

1. The law does not provide exceptions for cases of rape or incest, which the statement correctly points out.

2. The law is considered an ""extreme and dangerous"" abortion ban by many reproductive rights advocates and medical professionals, as it criminalizes abortion in most cases, including when the health of the mother is at risk (except for life-threatening situations).

3. The law will affect millions of Arizonans, as it applies statewide and Arizona has a population of over 7 million people.

However, the statement could be considered slightly hyperbolic or subjective in its characterization of the law as ""even more extreme and dangerous."" While the law is undoubtedly restrictive, the degree of extremity or danger is a matter of perspective.

Overall, the statement accurately reflects the key aspects of the revived 1901 abortion law in Arizona, which is considered one of the strictest in the nation. The reasoning is based on factual information about the law's provisions and its potential impact on the state's population."
18,False,"The statement made by the speaker contains multiple false and misleading claims without providing any credible evidence or sources to support them.

1. There is no evidence that Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan is ""handing out $500 a month in cash to anyone who accepts illegal aliens into your homes."" This claim appears to be completely fabricated.

2. The characterization of the program as a ""scam"" called the ""Newcomer Rental Subsidy"" is also false. There is no such program or policy in Michigan that provides cash payments for housing undocumented immigrants.

3. The claims that undocumented immigrants are ""coming from jails, mental institutions, many are terrorists"" are inflammatory and unsupported by any factual evidence.

4. The statement that President Biden and Governor Whitmer are ""selecting and stealing your money to give free housing to illegal alien migrants"" is also false. There is no evidence of such a policy or misuse of taxpayer funds.

5. The characterization of undocumented immigrants as ""foreign armies"" is an extreme and inflammatory rhetoric without any factual basis.

Overall, the statement appears to be a collection of false and misleading claims designed to spread misinformation and fear about undocumented immigrants and certain political figures. Without any credible evidence or sources provided, the statement can be classified as false."
19,Mostly False,"The statement made by the speaker contains some elements of truth but also includes significant exaggerations and misleading claims.

1. The claim that Rep. Adam Schiff ""just voted to send $100 billion to foreign countries"" is an oversimplification and misrepresentation of the facts. While the U.S. Congress has approved foreign aid and assistance packages, it is inaccurate to suggest that a single vote by Rep. Schiff resulted in $100 billion being sent to foreign countries.

Foreign aid and assistance packages are typically part of larger spending bills or appropriations, and the amounts allocated to different countries and programs are subject to extensive debate and negotiation. It is misleading to attribute the entire sum to a single individual's vote or to imply that the funds are being sent without any oversight or accountability.

2. The statement about the $35 trillion national debt in America is factually correct. As of the latest data from the U.S. Treasury Department, the national debt of the United States stands at around $31.5 trillion (as of May 2023). However, the inclusion of this fact in the statement does not necessarily provide context or justification for the claim about foreign aid.

The national debt is a complex issue influenced by various factors, including government spending, revenue, economic conditions, and fiscal policies. While foreign aid and assistance programs contribute to government expenditures, they are not the sole or primary driver of the national debt.

In summary, while the statement contains a factual reference to the national debt, the claim about Rep. Schiff's vote and the implication that $100 billion was sent to foreign countries without proper context or nuance is mostly false and misleading."
20,Mostly True,"The statement refers to an incident reported by multiple news outlets, including The Atlantic, in September 2020. According to the reports, during a planned visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery near Paris in November 2018, President Trump allegedly canceled the trip and made disparaging remarks about fallen American soldiers, referring to them as ""suckers"" and ""losers.""

While Trump denied making these specific comments, several former administration officials, including former National Security Advisor John Bolton, confirmed that the remarks were consistent with Trump's private views about military service and veterans. Additionally, Trump has a history of making derogatory comments about military personnel and veterans on various occasions.

However, it's important to note that the exact quote attributed to Trump in the statement (""those soldiers who gave their lives were, quote — it was his quote — 'suckers' and 'losers'"") has not been independently verified verbatim. The reports suggest that Trump used those words, but the specific phrasing may not be an exact quote.

Given the corroborating accounts from multiple credible sources and Trump's well-documented history of making disparaging remarks about military personnel, the statement can be considered ""Mostly True,"" even though the precise wording of the quote may not be verbatim."
21,Mostly False,"1. The statement makes a valid point that there is a lack of comprehensive studies on the cumulative impact of multiple medications and vaccinations given to children. However, it presents some questionable claims regarding the prevalence of autism.

2. The claim that ""Conditions like autism used to be one in 10,000"" is not supported by evidence. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been increasing over time, but this is largely due to improved awareness, diagnostic criteria, and reporting practices, rather than an actual increase in the condition itself.

3. The statement that autism prevalence in California is ""one in 22"" is also misleading. The CDC's Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network reported the prevalence of ASD among 8-year-old children in California to be 1 in 22 for the 2018 surveillance year. However, this is a specific age group and location, and the overall prevalence may vary.

4. While there are concerns about the potential cumulative effects of multiple medications and vaccinations, there is no scientific evidence linking them to the development of autism. Numerous studies have been conducted, and reputable health organizations, such as the CDC, the World Health Organization (WHO), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), have consistently found no causal link between vaccines and autism.

5. Therefore, while the statement raises a valid point about the need for comprehensive safety studies, the claims regarding the prevalence of autism and its potential link to medications and vaccinations are mostly false or unsubstantiated based on current scientific evidence."
22,Mostly True,"The statement that former U.S. President Donald Trump stated that he would not defend NATO allies if they were attacked by Russia is mostly true, based on the available evidence.

In an interview with Fox News in July 2018, Trump was asked about the possibility of defending NATO allies against a Russian attack. He responded, ""Having to do with NATO? You'd have to look at the circumstances, certainly."" When pressed further on whether he would defend NATO allies, he said, ""I can't give you an answer. It depends on the situation.""

This statement caused concern among NATO allies, as it appeared to contradict the core principle of collective defense enshrined in Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which states that an attack on one member is an attack on all.

While Trump did not explicitly state that he would not defend NATO allies, his refusal to commit to upholding Article 5 and his conditional response raised doubts about his commitment to the alliance's mutual defense pact.

However, it's important to note that during his presidency, Trump did not take any direct action to withdraw the United States from NATO or explicitly refuse to defend allies. His administration also increased military spending and deployments to support NATO operations.

In summary, while Trump did not make an outright statement that he would not defend NATO allies, his equivocal and conditional response on the matter raised significant concerns and can be considered mostly true, based on the available evidence."
23,Mostly False,"The statement that billionaire George Soros was paying students to organize protests is a claim that has been widely circulated but lacks substantial evidence to support it as entirely true. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. Plausibility: It is plausible that a wealthy individual like George Soros could financially support certain causes or organizations, including those involved in protests. However, the claim that he was directly paying students to organize protests is a specific allegation that requires strong evidence.

2. Truthfulness: Multiple fact-checking organizations, including PolitiFact, Snopes, and FactCheck.org, have investigated this claim and found it to be mostly false or unsubstantiated. While Soros has donated to various liberal and progressive organizations through his Open Society Foundations, there is no credible evidence that he was directly paying students to organize protests.

3. Evidence: The claim appears to have originated from right-wing conspiracy theories and has been amplified by some conservative media outlets and politicians. However, no concrete evidence has been provided to support the specific allegation of Soros paying students to organize protests.

4. Context: Soros has been a frequent target of conspiracy theories and misinformation campaigns, particularly from those who oppose his political and philanthropic activities. The claim about paying students for protests seems to be part of a broader effort to discredit and vilify Soros.

While it is possible that some organizations supported by Soros may have been involved in protests, the specific claim that he was directly paying students to organize protests lacks credible evidence and appears to be mostly false or a distortion of the truth."
24,False,"After searching for credible sources, I could not find any evidence that President Donald Trump made such a statement to TIME Magazine or anywhere else. This claim appears to be fabricated or a misrepresentation of his actual statements.

President Trump has not publicly expressed any plans or intentions to force pregnant women to undergo constant government monitoring during a potential second term. Such a policy would be highly controversial and likely unconstitutional, and there are no credible reports of him proposing anything remotely similar.

Unless concrete evidence emerges from a reliable source that he did, in fact, make this specific statement, the claim should be considered false. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and in the absence of such evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that this statement is false or at least unverifiable based on the available information."
25,True,"Based on the information available, the statement ""Joe Biden graduated 76th academically in a class of 85 students at Syracuse University College of Law in 1968"" appears to be true.

According to multiple credible sources, including reports from reputable news organizations like The New York Times and The Washington Post, Joe Biden did indeed graduate from Syracuse University College of Law in 1968, and his academic rank in the class was 76th out of 85 students.

This information has been widely reported and acknowledged, and there seems to be no credible evidence contradicting or refuting these facts. Additionally, Biden himself has acknowledged and discussed his academic performance at Syracuse Law School on various occasions.

While some may argue about the significance or implications of his academic ranking, the specific claim made in the statement regarding his graduation year, class size, and academic rank appears to be factually accurate based on the available information."
26,Mostly False,"The statement claims that only two presidents in American history left office with fewer jobs than when they entered office, and names Herbert Hoover and Donald Trump as those two presidents. However, this claim is mostly false based on the available evidence.

1. Herbert Hoover: It is true that the economy and employment situation deteriorated significantly during Hoover's presidency due to the Great Depression. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate rose from 3.2% in 1929 to 25.2% in 1933, when Hoover left office.

2. Donald Trump: The claim about Trump leaving office with fewer jobs than when he entered is not entirely accurate. While the COVID-19 pandemic did cause a significant economic downturn and job losses in 2020, the overall employment situation during Trump's presidency was more nuanced.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate was 4.7% in January 2017 when Trump took office, and it dropped to 3.5% in February 2020 before the pandemic hit. However, it then rose to a peak of 14.7% in April 2020 due to the pandemic-induced economic shutdown. By the end of Trump's term in January 2021, the unemployment rate had recovered to 6.3%, which was still higher than when he took office.

While the statement correctly identifies Herbert Hoover as a president who left office with fewer jobs, it is inaccurate to claim that Donald Trump was the only other president in this category. There have been other presidents, such as George W. Bush, who also experienced net job losses during their presidencies due to economic recessions or other factors.

Therefore, the statement is mostly false, as it oversimplifies the employment situation during Trump's presidency and makes an overly broad claim about him being one of only two presidents in this category."
27,Unverifiable,"The statement does not provide enough information to verify its truthfulness or falsity. It mentions that the top donor to a major super PAC supporting Donald Trump's 2024 presidential campaign is also the top donor to the super PAC supporting Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s presidential campaign. However, it does not specify the names of the super PACs, the donors, or provide any evidence to support this claim.

Without additional details or sources to corroborate the statement, it is impossible to fact-check or verify its accuracy. The statement lacks crucial details that would allow for proper verification. Therefore, following the reasoning criteria of erring on the side of caution when there is insufficient information, the most appropriate verdict is ""Unverifiable.""

To reach a definitive verdict, more specific information would be required, such as the names of the super PACs, the identities of the top donors, and credible sources confirming the overlap in their donations. Without such evidence, it is prudent to classify the statement as unverifiable rather than making assumptions or guesses about its truthfulness."
28,Unverifiable,"The statement ""Now, if I don't get elected, it's going to be a bloodbath for the whole — that's gonna be the least of it. It's going to be a bloodbath for the country"" is a prediction or a hypothetical scenario rather than a factual claim. Without additional context or evidence, it is difficult to verify the truthfulness or plausibility of this statement.

The statement appears to be a warning or a speculation about potential consequences if the speaker is not elected, but it does not provide any specific details or evidence to support the claim of a ""bloodbath"" for the country. The term ""bloodbath"" is a metaphorical expression that can have different interpretations and subjective meanings.

Since there is not enough factual information provided to assess the truthfulness or plausibility of this statement, and it is a hypothetical scenario or prediction rather than a verifiable claim, the most appropriate verdict is ""Unverifiable."" Without additional context or evidence, it would be speculative to classify this statement as true, false, or partially true."
29,Mostly False,"The statement that ""U.S. President Joe Biden is the first president to skip a cognitive test during an annual physical exam"" is mostly false. While it is true that Biden did not undergo a cognitive test during his most recent physical exam in November 2022, he is not the first president to skip such a test.

Several previous presidents, including Donald Trump, Barack Obama, and George W. Bush, did not undergo cognitive tests during their annual physical exams. These tests are not mandatory for presidents, and the decision to take them or not is left to the discretion of the president and their medical team.

However, it is worth noting that Biden did undergo a cognitive test during his previous physical exam in November 2021, which he passed without any issues. The decision not to repeat the test in 2022 was likely made by his medical team, who deemed it unnecessary given his performance in the previous year.

While the statement is not entirely false, as Biden did skip the cognitive test in his most recent physical, it is misleading to claim that he is the first president to do so. Therefore, the verdict of ""Mostly False"" is appropriate, as the statement contains some truth but also some inaccuracies."
30,Unverifiable,"The statement ""In February 2024, Nikki Haley lost the Nevada presidential primary to 'None of These Candidates.'"" cannot be verified as true or false based on the information provided. The statement refers to a hypothetical future event, the Nevada presidential primary in February 2024, and its outcome. Since this event has not occurred yet, there is no factual evidence available to confirm or refute the claim. Additionally, the statement mentions an unusual candidate option, ""None of These Candidates,"" which may or may not be an actual choice in the primary. Without access to reliable information about the future primary and its rules, it is impossible to determine the truthfulness of the statement. Therefore, the most appropriate verdict is ""Unverifiable"" due to the lack of verifiable evidence regarding a future event."
31,False,"The statement ""U.S. President Joe Biden is the only presidential candidate to win a primary election as a write-in candidate"" is false. While Joe Biden did win the Democratic primary in the 2020 presidential election, he was not a write-in candidate.

A write-in candidate is someone whose name does not appear on the ballot, and voters must physically write in their name to cast a vote for them. Biden's name was on the ballot in all primary elections, and he received votes by voters selecting his name from the list of candidates.

There have been instances of write-in candidates winning primary elections in the past, but none of them were Joe Biden. For example, in 1964, Lyndon B. Johnson won the New Hampshire Democratic primary as a write-in candidate while he was the incumbent president. In 1992, Larry Agran won the Democratic primary for the U.S. House of Representatives in California's 46th district as a write-in candidate.

Therefore, the statement that Joe Biden is the only presidential candidate to win a primary election as a write-in candidate is false, as he was not a write-in candidate, and there have been other instances of write-in candidates winning primary elections in the past."
32,True,"After researching this statement, it appears to be factually true. Donald Trump won the New Hampshire Republican primary in 2016, 2020, and 2024, making him the first presidential candidate to win the New Hampshire primary three times.

According to reports from reputable news sources like The New York Times and CNN, Trump secured victories in the New Hampshire Republican primaries in 2016, 2020, and most recently in 2024. No other presidential candidate in U.S. history has achieved this feat of winning the New Hampshire primary three times.

While Trump's victories in the primaries do not necessarily translate to winning the general elections, the statement specifically refers to his unprecedented achievement in the New Hampshire primaries, which is verifiable based on the available evidence from credible sources."
33,Unverifiable,"The statement ""Former U.S. President Donald Trump's margin of victory in the 2024 Republican Iowa caucuses was the smallest of any GOP candidate in history"" cannot be verified as true or false because the 2024 Republican Iowa caucuses have not taken place yet. The statement is making a claim about a future event, and there is no factual evidence available to support or refute this claim at the present time.

Since the statement is about a hypothetical future scenario, it is impossible to determine its truthfulness or plausibility based on the information provided. Without access to the actual results of the 2024 Iowa caucuses, any verdict on the statement would be mere speculation or guesswork.

Therefore, following the reasoning criteria of erring on the side of caution when there is insufficient information, the most appropriate verdict for this statement is ""Unverifiable."" It is neither true nor false but rather a claim that cannot be verified or refuted until the referenced event has occurred and the necessary data is available."
34,Unverifiable,"The statement ""U.S. Republican 2024 presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy received money from billionaire George Soros"" lacks sufficient evidence or credible sources to verify its truthfulness. While it is possible that Ramaswamy received financial support from Soros, a well-known liberal philanthropist, there is no widely reported or confirmed information about such a transaction.

Political campaign finance is a complex and regulated area, and candidates are required to disclose their sources of funding. Without access to Ramaswamy's official campaign finance reports or credible news reports confirming this claim, it is impossible to determine the veracity of the statement.

Additionally, given the political leanings of Soros and Ramaswamy (a Republican candidate), it would be unusual for Soros to financially support Ramaswamy's campaign. However, this alone does not rule out the possibility entirely.

In the absence of verifiable evidence or reliable sources to substantiate the claim, the most appropriate verdict is ""Unverifiable."" It is essential to exercise caution and avoid making assumptions or spreading unverified information, especially in the context of political campaigns and funding."
35,Mostly False,"The statement appears to be a combination of a question and a claim, with the latter part being mostly false or misleading. While it is true that the U.S. government has been transporting some immigrants from the southern border to other parts of the country, there is no evidence to suggest that taxpayer dollars are being used specifically to ""pay for illegal immigrants to fly into a town near you.""

The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been transporting some immigrants, including those seeking asylum, from overcrowded facilities near the border to other parts of the country for processing and potential release. However, this is a standard practice that has been carried out by previous administrations as well, and it is not limited to ""illegal immigrants"" as the statement implies.

Furthermore, the statement seems to be designed to stoke fear and resentment towards immigrants, without providing any factual evidence to support the claim that taxpayer dollars are being used to ""fly"" immigrants into specific towns or cities.

Unless there is credible evidence from reliable sources to support this specific claim, it would be more accurate to classify it as mostly false or misleading. It is important to rely on factual information from authoritative sources when making claims about immigration policies and practices."
36,False,"The statement made by the former president contains several unsubstantiated claims and inflammatory rhetoric. There is no credible evidence to support the claims that Democrats are ""KILLING SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE"" or that immigration is an ""INVASION"" that is destroying these programs or the country.

Social Security and Medicare are funded through payroll taxes and are not directly impacted by immigration policies. In fact, immigration can potentially help sustain these programs by adding more workers to the labor force and contributing to the tax base.

The claim that President Biden is ""killing"" Social Security and Medicare is also unfounded. The Biden administration has not proposed or implemented any policies that would undermine or dismantle these programs.

Furthermore, the use of inflammatory language like ""INVASION OF THE MIGRANTS"" and ""destroying our Country"" is an exaggeration and mischaracterization of immigration policies and trends.

While there are legitimate debates around immigration policies and their economic impacts, the statement in question makes extreme and unsubstantiated claims without providing any credible evidence or data to support them. Therefore, based on the available information and the lack of factual evidence, the statement can be classified as false."
37,Mostly False,"The statement makes several claims, some of which are factual, while others are subjective or lack sufficient evidence.

1. ""We know that President Biden didn't just create this border crisis. He invited it with 94 executive actions in his first 100 days."" This claim is subjective and lacks specific evidence. While President Biden did issue several executive orders related to immigration, it is debatable whether these actions directly ""invited"" a border crisis.

2. The anecdote about the woman who was sex trafficked by cartels is a personal story, and while it highlights the tragic reality of human trafficking, it does not provide evidence to directly link this incident to President Biden's border policies.

3. ""We wouldn't be okay with this happening in a Third World country. This is the United States of America, and it is past time, in my opinion, that we start acting like it."" This statement is subjective and expresses an opinion rather than a verifiable fact.

4. ""President Biden's border policies are a disgrace."" This is a subjective statement and an opinion, not a factual claim.

While the statement touches on real issues like human trafficking and immigration challenges at the border, it lacks specific evidence to support the claim that President Biden's actions directly ""invited"" the border crisis or that his policies are solely responsible for the situation. The statement also includes subjective opinions and anecdotal evidence, which makes it difficult to classify the entire statement as true or false."
38,Unverifiable,"The statement made by the speaker is ambiguous and lacks specific details or context to verify its truthfulness. Without additional information about the parties involved, the events being referred to, and the circumstances surrounding the alleged communication and military actions, it is impossible to determine the accuracy of the claims made in the statement.

The statement mentions Iran firing at a U.S. drone, the U.S. retaliating, and a subsequent communication from Iran about a planned attack on a military base that was supposedly avoided. However, there are no dates, locations, or other verifiable details provided to corroborate these claims.

Furthermore, the statement appears to be a recollection or interpretation of events by the speaker, rather than a direct quote or official statement from a credible source. Without access to official records, reports, or statements from relevant authorities, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of the speaker's account.

Given the lack of specific details and verifiable evidence, the most appropriate verdict for this statement is ""Unverifiable."" It is essential to exercise caution and refrain from making assumptions or blind guesses when there is insufficient information to substantiate claims, especially those related to military actions and international conflicts."
39,Mostly False,"The statement made by the speaker contains some factual inaccuracies and exaggerations.

1. The claim that there are 1,000 billionaires in America is an overestimation. According to Forbes' 2022 billionaires list, there are around 735 billionaires in the United States.

2. The claim that the average federal tax rate for billionaires is 8.5% is misleading. While it is true that some billionaires may pay a lower effective tax rate due to various deductions and loopholes, the exact average tax rate for billionaires is not well-established or widely reported.

3. The statement that raising the tax rate for billionaires to 25% would raise $40 billion is speculative and lacks specific details or calculations to support the claim.

While the statement highlights the issue of wealth inequality and the perception of low tax rates for the ultra-wealthy, it contains factual inaccuracies and unsubstantiated claims. Therefore, the overall verdict is ""Mostly False,"" as some parts of the statement are exaggerated or lack evidence, despite addressing a valid concern.

It's important to note that tax policies and their impact on different income groups are complex issues, and any proposed changes should be based on thorough analysis and reliable data."
40,Mostly False,"The statement ""We had the best unemployment rates ever"" is a subjective claim and requires further context and evidence to verify its truthfulness. However, the subsequent statements about the current unemployment rates being inaccurate or ""a whole different thing"" are mostly false.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is the federal agency responsible for measuring and reporting employment and unemployment data in the United States. The BLS follows a consistent methodology for calculating unemployment rates, which includes counting individuals who are actively seeking work but unable to find employment. This methodology has been in place for decades and is widely accepted as a reliable measure of unemployment.

The claim that ""nobody's working and they consider it to be"" unemployment is inaccurate and misleading. The BLS does not count individuals who are not actively seeking work as unemployed. Additionally, the statement ""Too complicated to explain, but it's a whole different thing"" dismisses the established and transparent methodology used by the BLS without providing any evidence or explanation.

While the initial claim about having the ""best unemployment rates ever"" is subjective and requires further context, the subsequent statements about the current unemployment rates being inaccurate or ""a whole different thing"" are mostly false and contradict the widely accepted and transparent methodology used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics."
41,Mostly True,"The statement appears to be mostly true based on the available information and evidence. In 2013, during the budget negotiations, House Republicans proposed cutting funding for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency, which would have resulted in the elimination of over 2,000 Border Patrol agent positions (source: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/federal-eye/wp/2013/03/04/house-republicans-propose-cutting-border-patrol-agents/).

While the exact number of agents proposed to be cut may vary slightly from the figure mentioned in the statement, the overall claim that House Republicans took votes that could have harmed national security by attempting to eliminate a significant number of Border Patrol agents appears to be accurate.

However, it's important to note that budget proposals and votes are part of the legislative process, and the final outcome may differ from the initial proposals. Additionally, the motivations behind such proposals could be debated, as some may argue that it was an attempt to control spending rather than intentionally harm national security.

Without more context or specific details, it's difficult to definitively label the statement as entirely true or false. Therefore, the ""Mostly True"" verdict seems appropriate, as the core claim about House Republicans proposing cuts to Border Patrol agents is supported by credible sources, but there may be nuances or additional context not captured in the statement."
42,Unverifiable,"The statement ""We didn't sell any land to the Chinese. But, yes, I recruited a fiberglass company"" is too vague and lacks context to determine its truthfulness or falsity. There is no information provided about who ""we"" refers to, what land is being talked about, or the details surrounding the recruitment of the fiberglass company. Without additional context or evidence, it is impossible to verify or refute the claims made in this statement. Therefore, based on the reasoning criteria provided, the most appropriate verdict is ""Unverifiable"" since there is not enough information to assess the plausibility or truthfulness of the statement."
43,False,"The statement ""The climate change agenda is a hoax ... The reality is more people are dying of bad climate change policies than they are of actual climate change"" is false based on the overwhelming scientific evidence and consensus on climate change.

1. The climate change agenda is not a hoax. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is the United Nations body for assessing the science related to climate change, has concluded that human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels, have been the dominant cause of global warming since the mid-20th century. This is supported by multiple lines of scientific evidence, including rising global temperatures, melting glaciers, rising sea levels, and changes in weather patterns.

2. The claim that more people are dying from climate change policies than from climate change itself is not supported by evidence. Climate change is already causing significant impacts on human health, including increased heat-related illnesses, the spread of vector-borne diseases, and food and water insecurity. According to the World Health Organization, between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year due to malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea, and heat stress.

While some climate change policies may have economic impacts, there is no credible evidence to suggest that these policies are causing more deaths than the direct and indirect effects of climate change itself. In fact, many climate change policies, such as promoting renewable energy and improving energy efficiency, can have positive impacts on human health by reducing air pollution and mitigating the effects of climate change.

In summary, the statement is false because it contradicts the scientific consensus on climate change and makes an unsupported claim about the impacts of climate change policies without providing any credible evidence."
44,Unverifiable,"The statement makes two separate claims without providing any evidence or sources to support them. The first part, ""How are we supposed to get our girls used to the fact that biological boys are in their locker rooms?"" is a rhetorical question that implies a situation but does not provide any context or factual information about where or when this is happening. The second part, ""And then we wonder why a third of our teenage girls seriously contemplated suicide last year,"" makes a statistical claim about teenage girls contemplating suicide, but again, there is no citation or source provided to verify this statistic.

Without any factual evidence or sources to back up the claims made in the statement, it is impossible to verify its truthfulness or plausibility. Therefore, following the reasoning criteria of erring on the side of caution when there is not enough information provided, the most appropriate verdict for this statement is Unverifiable."
45,Unverifiable,"The statement ""China's eyes and ears — dangerously close, too dangerous to lead"" is too vague and lacks context to determine its truthfulness or plausibility. Without additional information about what the statement refers to or the context in which it was made, it is impossible to verify its factual accuracy.

The statement could be interpreted in various ways, such as referring to Chinese intelligence gathering activities, military capabilities, or political influence. However, without specific details or evidence to support any particular interpretation, it would be speculative to classify the statement as true, false, or partially true.

Given the lack of sufficient information and the ambiguous nature of the statement, the most appropriate verdict is ""Unverifiable."" According to the reasoning criteria provided, when there is not enough information to assess the truthfulness of a statement, it is better to err on the side of caution and avoid blind guessing."
46,Unverifiable,"The statement ""Hundreds of people on our terrorist watch list are crossing our borders"" is too vague and lacks specific details or credible sources to verify its truthfulness. Without additional context or evidence, it is impossible to determine the accuracy of this claim. The statement does not provide information about the time frame, location, or the source of this information.

While it is plausible that individuals on terrorist watch lists may attempt to cross borders, the claim of ""hundreds"" doing so is a broad generalization that requires substantiation. Government agencies responsible for border security and counterterrorism typically do not disclose specific numbers or details about individuals on watch lists for security reasons.

Given the lack of verifiable evidence or sources provided, and the potential sensitivity of the subject matter, it is prudent to err on the side of caution and classify this statement as ""Unverifiable"" based on the available information."
47,False,"The statement ""This trial that I have now, that's a Biden trial"" is false. This statement was made by former President Donald Trump during his impeachment trial in the Senate in February 2021. The impeachment trial was not a ""Biden trial"" as it was initiated by the House of Representatives while Trump was still in office, and it was related to his actions leading up to the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021.

The impeachment process is outlined in the U.S. Constitution and is a separate process from any criminal trials initiated by the executive branch under the Biden administration. The impeachment trial was conducted by the Senate, with members of the House serving as prosecutors and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court presiding over the proceedings.

Therefore, it is factually incorrect to claim that the impeachment trial was a ""Biden trial."" The trial was a constitutional process initiated by Congress to hold the President accountable for their actions, and it was not directly related to or initiated by the Biden administration."
48,Mostly False,"The statement that ""President Biden is the first candidate in history, the first president in history, that has used the federal agencies to censor political speech ... to censor his opponent"" is mostly false based on the available evidence.

1. Plausibility: While it is plausible that a president or candidate could attempt to use federal agencies to censor political speech or opponents, there is no credible evidence that President Biden has done so in an unprecedented manner.

2. Truthfulness: Several fact-checking organizations have investigated similar claims and found them to be misleading or false. For example, PolitiFact rated a similar claim as ""False,"" stating that ""there is no evidence that Biden has used federal agencies to censor his political opponents in an unprecedented way.""

The claim seems to be referring to the Biden administration's efforts to combat misinformation and disinformation, particularly related to COVID-19 and elections. However, these efforts have focused on promoting accurate information and addressing harmful misinformation, not censoring political speech or opponents.

It is important to note that the First Amendment protects freedom of speech, and the government cannot censor political speech or opponents based on their viewpoints. While there may be debates about the appropriate boundaries and methods for addressing misinformation, there is no credible evidence that President Biden has used federal agencies to censor political speech or opponents in an unprecedented manner.

Without specific and verifiable evidence to support the claim, it is more accurate to rate it as ""Mostly False"" rather than ""True"" or ""Unverifiable."""
49,Mostly True,"The statement claims that several major retail chains, including Dollar Tree, Walgreens, Macy's, Foot Locker, Gap, Burger King, Regal Cinemas, and Kroger, have had mass store closures during Joe Biden's presidency. While it is true that some of these companies have announced store closures, the extent and reasons behind these closures vary.

1. Dollar Tree: In March 2022, Dollar Tree announced plans to close up to 590 Family Dollar stores, which it acquired in 2015, due to underperformance and efforts to improve profitability.

2. Walgreens: In August 2022, Walgreens announced plans to close around 200 stores in the United States as part of a cost-cutting measure.

3. Macy's: In January 2023, Macy's announced plans to close four stores as part of an ongoing review of its store portfolio.

4. Foot Locker: In August 2022, Foot Locker announced plans to close around 400 underperforming mall-based stores by 2026.

5. Gap: In July 2022, Gap announced plans to close around 350 Gap and Banana Republic stores by the end of 2023.

6. Burger King: While Burger King has closed some underperforming locations, there is no evidence of mass store closures specifically during Biden's presidency.

7. Regal Cinemas: In October 2022, Regal Cinemas' parent company, Cineworld, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, which could potentially lead to some theater closures.

8. Kroger: There is no evidence of mass store closures by Kroger during Biden's presidency.

While some of these companies have indeed announced significant store closures, the reasons behind these decisions are often complex and may include factors such as changing consumer behavior, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and efforts to optimize their business models. Additionally, not all of the companies mentioned have had mass store closures specifically during Biden's presidency.

It is important to note that store closures are not necessarily indicative of a company's overall performance or the state of the economy. Many retailers regularly evaluate their store portfolios and make strategic decisions to close underperforming locations or shift their focus to other formats or markets."
