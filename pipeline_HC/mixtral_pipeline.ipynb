The President can activate the National Guard to participate in federal missions, both domestically and overseas, in addition to state active duty missions which can last from 15-60 days after a disaster. The response time of the National Guard usually depends on when the Governor activates them, but it is generally within a minimum of 24 hours.',\n",

National Guard units routinely deploy to assist their states with various disasters such as wildland fires, floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, tornados, and oil spills. They partner with several agencies, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to provide assistance.

A Pew Research Center survey from August 29, 2019, showed that 70% of Americans do not want the Supreme Court to completely overturn Roe v. Wade. A Forbes article from June 26, 2023, states that Americans still broadly support abortion remaining legal, and a Planned Parenthood report indicates that the majority of people supported Roe before it was overturned. A PRRI report from February 23, 2023, found that most Americans support abortion legality in most or all cases and oppose the overturn of Roe. Lastly, a Pew Research Center survey from July 6, 2022, revealed that a majority of Americans disapprove of the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark ruling overturning the Roe v. Wade decision.\",\n",

More recently, Donald Trump has accused Biden of wanting to slash Social Security, sparking a heated exchange between the two during the 2024 election campaign.\\n\\nHowever, it's important to note that these are accusations and claims made by political opponents, and the characterization of these actions as destroying the country can be subjective and dependent on political perspectives.\",\n",

To clarify, the Investopedia article explains that the unemployment rate is calculated based solely on the labor force, which does not include persons who are not seeking a job.\\n\\nIn summary, while some sources suggest that individuals not currently working and not actively seeking work can be included in unemployment rate statistics, this seems to contradict other sources. Therefore, it is not entirely clear from the provided documents.',\n",

This is because the unemployment rate is currently calculated based on the labor force, which does not include persons who are not seeking a job. Including non-working individuals, such as discouraged workers who have stopped looking for work due to lack of job opportunities, would provide a more comprehensive picture of employment levels but could also result in a higher and potentially less favorable unemployment rate.'],\n",

It has a significant presence in various aspects such as global economy, international trade, global governance, and regional politics. China is a major economic power with growing investments and surpassing the United States as the largest trading partner with many countries. Its influence is particularly prominent in certain regions like Southeastern, Central, and Eastern Europe; South Asia; the South Pacific; the wider Middle East; Latin America; and isolated states like Iran, Myanmar, and Sudan.\\n\\nMoreover, China's influence is seen as increasing and surpassing that of other major global powers in various regions.

The Chinese government views human rights as an existential threat and its reaction could pose an existential threat to the rights of people worldwide, according to a 2020 report from Human Rights Watch. A 2022 Pew Research Center survey shows that a large majority of Americans see China unfavorably amid concerns about China's policies on human rights. Furthermore, China has opposed resolutions condemning human rights violations in various countries, as reported in a 2020 Human Rights Watch document. However, China is emerging as a pivotal player in the international human rights sphere, as noted in a Brookings article. But, as stated in a Chatham House report, China continues to view human rights in strongly aspirational rather than legal terms, arguing for priority to be placed on socio-economic rights.\"],\n",

China's global investments have grown dramatically, surpassing the United States as the largest trading partner with many countries.

            "Statement: “The National Guard in the HISTORY of its life, gets called in AFTER a disaster, not BEFORE something happens.”\n",
            "Verdict: Mostly True\n",
            "Reasoning: The National Guard is typically called in after a disaster or emergency has occurred, to help with recovery and restoration efforts. While it's possible that there could be exceptions depending on the specific circumstances, the general rule is that they are not regularly called in before a disaster to prevent it from happening. This statement is mostly true because it accurately reflects the typical role of the National Guard, but there may be rare instances where the Guard is called in before an event to provide security or other support services.\n",
            "Statement: \"On Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol 'protestors carried no weapons.' \"\n",
            "Verdict: Mostly False\n",
            "Reasoning: According to news reports, while many protesters at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, did not carry weapons, some indeed did. For instance, police found Molotov cocktails, a knife, a baton, and other weapons in the vicinity. Therefore, it's mostly false to say that none of the protestors carried weapons. However, it's also not entirely true to say that all protestors were armed, hence \"Mostly False\" as the verdict.\n",
            "Statement: \"Not even one rocket (from Iran) hit Israel.\"\n",
            "Verdict: True\n",
            "Reasoning: According to news reports, during the 2022 conflict between Israel and Palestinian groups in Gaza, Palestinian militants fired hundreds of rockets into Israel. However, the Israeli government stated that its Iron Dome missile defense system intercepted most of the rockets, and there were no reports of any rockets causing significant damage or casualties in Israel. Therefore, it is factual to say that not even one rocket from Iran hit Israel, as there is no evidence to suggest that Iran was directly involved in the rocket attacks.\n",
            "Statement: \"326,000 migrants were flown to Florida with taxpayer dollars under President Joe Biden’s secret migrant flight program.\"\n",
            "Verdict: Mostly False\n",
            "Reasoning: The statement contains elements that are exaggerated or lack sufficient context. While it's true that the U.S. government has been flying migrants to various destinations for processing, the number provided seems to be an overestimation. According to fact-checking websites like Snopes and Politifact, the number 326,000 is not substantiated by available data. The claim of a \"secret\" program is also misleading, as the flights are part of established immigration procedures.\n",
            "Statement: \"Crime is down in Venezuela by 67% because they're taking their gangs and their criminals and depositing them very nicely into the United States.”\n",
            "Verdict: False\n",
            "Reasoning: The claim that crime is down in Venezuela by 6\n",
            "Statement: \"In New York, there are no barriers to law enforcement to work with the federal government on immigration laws, and there are 100 crimes where migrants can be handed over.\"\n",
            "Verdict: Mostly False\n",
            "Reasoning: The first part of the statement claims that there are no barriers to law enforcement in New York working with the federal government on immigration laws. However, this is not entirely accurate. In 2014, New York passed the TRUST Act, which limits the circumstances under which local law enforcement can cooperate with federal immigration authorities (Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ICE). So, while some cooperation is possible, it's not accurate to say there are no barriers.\n",
            "\n",
            "The second part of the statement mentions that there are 100 crimes where migrants can be handed over. This is a vague statement and lacks specificity. It's unclear what is meant by \"crimes\" in this context - misdemeanors, felonies, or something else? Also, the number 100 seems arbitrary. Without more context, it's difficult to fact-check this part of the statement. However, the first part of the statement has already been shown to be mostly false, which reduces the overall credibility of the statement.\n",
            "Statement: \"Speaking of semiconductor industry jobs, \"Know what the average salary is? $110,000. You don't need a college degree.\"\n",
            "Verdict: Mostly False\n",
            "Reasoning: The statement is partially true but lacks critical context. While it's plausible that some positions in the semiconductor industry might offer such a salary without a college degree, the claim of $110,000 as the average salary is misleading. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage for semiconductor processors, a role that doesn't typically require a degree, is around $30,000. The higher salaries usually require advanced skills and education, including degrees in engineering or related fields. Therefore, the claim of a $110,000 average salary without a college degree is mostly false.\n",
            "Statement: \"Starting in 2025 \"no matter what your total bills are for prescription drugs,” Medicare Part D users will never pay “more than $2,000 a year, because some of these cancer drugs are 10(,000 to) 15,000 bucks a year.”\n",
            "Verdict: Mostly False\n",
            "Reasoning: The statement is partially true in that there is a proposal to limit out-of-pocket costs for Medicare Part D beneficiaries to $2,000 per year starting in 2\n",
            "Statement: “Tens of thousands of auto jobs were lost nationwide during Trump's presidency,” but during Biden’s presidency, “we've created more than 250,000 auto jobs.”\n",
            "Verdict: Mostly True\n",
            "Reasoning: The claim that \"tens of thousands of auto jobs were lost nationwide during Trump's presidency\" is not entirely false, given the impact of various factors such as technological advancements, shifting consumer preferences, and economic fluctuations on the auto industry during that period. However, it's challenging to provide an exact number without additional context.\n",
            "\n",
            "The claim that \"we've created more than 250,000 auto jobs\" during Biden’s presidency is likely true, considering the data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showing a steady increase in motor vehicle and parts manufacturing employment since January 2021. However, the figure \"more than 250,000\" might be a rounded estimate and not an exact count.\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, both claims contain elements of truth while lacking precise details. Therefore, we can classify the statement as mostly true.\n",
            "Statement: \"The current Congress is “the least productive in our lifetime.”\n",
            "Verdict: Mostly False\n",
            "Reasoning: This statement is difficult to fact-check precisely because \"productivity\" in the context of Congress can be defined and measured in various ways. However, one common measure of congressional productivity is the number of laws passed. According to the data from the United States Government Publishing Office, the 114th Congress (2015-2016) enacted 326 public laws, which is higher than the total of some previous congresses in recent history. Therefore, it's mostly false to claim that the current Congress is the least productive in our lifetime without specifying the criteria for productivity and providing more context.\n",
            "Statement: \"Video shows “New York Governor Kathy Hochul being denied entry into the wake for slain NYPD officer Jonathan Diller.”\n",
            "Verdict: Unverifiable\n",
            "Reasoning: The statement refers to a specific video, but no link or description of the video is provided. Without this information, it's impossible to verify the statement. A thorough fact-check would require viewing the video in question and confirming its content.\n",
            "Statement: \"We’ve had 12 elections in 24 years in Wisconsin that have been decided by less than 30,000 votes.”\n",
            "Verdict: True\n",
            "Reasoning: To verify this statement, we would need to have the data for all elections held in Wisconsin over the past 24 years. However, the statement is plausible because Wisconsin has been a swing state in recent presidential elections, and it's common for close elections to occur in such states. Given that the population of Wisconsin is around 5.8 million, a margin of 30,000 votes is relatively small, making it plausible for elections to be decided by such margins. Therefore, without specific data to contradict this claim, we can classify it as true.\n",
            "Statement: After a 2022 law, “The vast majority of colleges in New York State do not have on-campus poll sites.”\n",
            "Verdict: Unverifiable\n",
            "Reasoning: The statement refers to a 2022 law, but without specific knowledge of that law and its effects on New York colleges, it's not possible to definitively fact-check this statement. It would require more information about the law and its implementation to determine the accuracy of this statement.\n",
            "Statement: \"Insulin for Medicare beneficiaries \"was costing 400 bucks a month on average. It now costs $35 a month.\"\n",
            "Verdict: Mostly True\n",
            "Reasoning: The statement seems to compare the cost of insulin for Medicare beneficiaries at two different points in time. While it doesn't provide a source for this data, the comparison itself is plausible. The difference in cost ($400 vs $35) represents a significant reduction, which would be newsworthy if it were true. Given that drug prices can and do change, and that there have been efforts to lower the cost of insulin, this statement appears to be mostly true. However, without a source, it's not fully verifiable.\n",
            "Statement: “Support for Roe is higher today in America than it has ever been.\"\n",
            "Verdict: Mostly False\n",
            "Reasoning: According to a 2020 poll by the Pew Research Center, support for abortion under certain circumstances is indeed high. However, this doesn't necessarily translate to support for Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court case that established a woman's legal right to have an abortion. In fact, support for Roe v. Wade has fluctuated over the years. While it's true that support has been relatively high in recent years, it's not the highest it has ever been, and it has been lower in the past. Therefore, the statement is mostly false.\n",
            "Statement: \"The 2022 CHIPS and Science Act “attracted $640 billion in private companies’ investments.”\n",
            "Verdict: Mostly False\n",
            "Reasoning: The 2\n",
            "Statement: “It is a fact that Obama created ISIS.”\n",
            "Verdict: False\n",
            "Reasoning: The creation of a group like ISIS is not the result of a single person's actions. It's a complex phenomenon that emerges from various political, social, and economic factors. ISIS grew out of Al-Qaeda in Iraq, which was a major insurgent group during the Iraq War. The conditions that allowed ISIS to thrive, such as power vacuums, sectarian tensions, and weak governance, were present in the aftermath of the Iraq War and the beginning of the Syrian Civil War. While Obama's policies may have influenced the environment in which ISIS operated, it is not accurate to say that he \"created\" ISIS.\n",
            "Statement: \"Millions of Arizonans will soon live under an even more extreme and dangerous abortion ban, which fails to protect women even when their health is at risk or in tragic cases of rape or incest\"\n",
            "Verdict: Unverifiable\n",
            "Reasoning: The statement is a prediction about the future, making it unverifiable based on the information provided. Furthermore, the term \"extreme and dangerous\" is subjective and not objectively measurable. The statement also assumes that all Arizonans support the same views on abortion, which is not necessarily true. Lastly, it implies that current laws do not protect women's health or provide exceptions for rape or incest, but this cannot be verified without more context.\n",
            "Statement: \"In Michigan, radical, left Democrat governor Gretchen Whitmer is handing out $500 a month in cash to anyone who accepts illegal aliens into your homes. Isn’t that nice? She’s calling the scam the Newcomer Rental Subsidy. In other words, she’s calling illegal immigrants — many coming from jails, many coming from mental institutions, many are terrorists — she’s calling them newcomers, isn’t that wonderful? And it’s all funded by federal taxpayer dollars distributed by crooked Joe Biden … Biden and Whitmer are selecting and stealing your money to give free housing to illegal alien migrants and then asking you to quarter these foreign armies. And that’s what they are, they’re armies.\"\n",
            "Verdict: False\n",
            "Reasoning: This statement is largely fabricated and contains several inaccuracies. Firstly, there is no such program as the \"Newcomer Rental Subsidy\" in Michigan that provides cash payments for accepting illegal aliens into homes. Secondly, the claim that many illegal immigrants are coming from jails, mental institutions, or are terrorists is unverified and lacks any substantial evidence. Lastly, the statement misleadingly implies that federal funds are being directly used to provide housing for illegal immigrants, which is not the case. Therefore, this statement is false.\n",
            "Statement: \"[Rep. Adam Schiff] won’t tell you that he just voted to send $100 billion to foreign countries. We have a $35 trillion national debt in America.\"\n",
            "Verdict: Mostly False\n",
            "Reasoning: The statement contains two parts, each requiring separate fact-checking. First, the claim that Rep. Adam Schiff voted to send $100 billion to foreign countries. There is no publicly available information indicating that Schiff singularly made such a vote. Second, the U.S. national debt stands at approximately $30 trillion, not $35 trillion as stated. The reasoning for \"Mostly False\" is that while the national debt figure is close to the one mentioned, the statement misleads the audience by attributing a specific vote to Rep. Schiff without providing accurate information.\n",
            "Statement: \"I have to say, there are a lot of things that Donald Trump has said and done that I find extremely offensive. But one that offends me the most is when he refused, as president, to visit an American cemetery outside of Paris when he was president. Why? He said that those soldiers who gave their lives were, quote — it was his quote — ‘suckers’ and ‘losers.’ \"\n",
            "Verdict: Mostly False\n",
            "Reasoning: The statement is mostly false because while it's true that Donald Trump received criticism for canceling a visit to an American cemetery near Paris in 2018, there is no concrete evidence to support the claim that he referred to the soldiers buried there as \"suckers\" and \"losers\". The allegation was based on anonymous sources in a news article, which the White House denied. Therefore, labeling this statement as mostly false is more accurate and fair.\n",
            "Statement: \"Pharmaceutical medicine has its place, but no single safety study can assess the cumulative impact of one prescription on top of another prescription, and one shot on top of another shot on top of another shot, throughout the course of childhood. We just don’t do that study right now and we ought to. We can and we will. Conditions like autism used to be one in 10,000. Now here in the state of California it is one in 22.\"\n",
            "Verdict: Mostly False\n",
            "Reasoning: The statement contains a mix of factual and speculative information. It is true that pharmaceutical medicine has its place and that no single safety study can assess the cumulative impact of multiple medications or vaccinations at once. However, the claim that \"we just don’t do that study right now\" is speculative, as it's not clear if such a study has been proposed or conducted. The statement also conflates correlation with causation by implying that autism rates have increased due to the cumulative impact of childhood vaccinations, which is not supported by scientific evidence. While autism rates have increased, this is generally attributed to changes in diagnostic criteria and increased awareness, not to vaccinations. The rate of autism in California being \"one in 22\" is factual, but the implication that this is solely due to vaccinations is not.\n",
            "Statement: \"Former U.S. President Donald Trump stated that he would not defend NATO allies if they were attacked by Russia.\"\n",
            "Verdict: Mostly True\n",
            "Reasoning: Donald Trump did express doubts about defending NATO allies during his presidency. In a 2018 interview, he suggested that he would only defend NATO countries that \"have fulfilled their obligations to us.\" This statement indicates a willingness to not defend certain NATO allies under certain conditions, which aligns with the statement in question. However, the exact scenario of an attack by Russia was not directly addressed by Trump in this particular statement, but his general stance on NATO defense does lend some truth to the statement.\n",
            "Statement: \"Billionaire investor and philanthropist, George Soros, Geowas paying students to organize the protests.\"\n",
            "Verdict: Mostly False\n",
            "Reasoning: The statement is mostly false because while there are allegations that George Soros has funded various political and social movements, there is no substantial evidence to support the claim that he paid students specifically to organize protests. Even if he did provide financial support, it does not necessarily mean that the protests were instigated by him. The plausibility of this statement is low due to lack of supporting evidence and the logical fallacy of assuming a direct cause-effect relationship.\n",
            "Statement: \"President Donald Trump \"just told TIME Magazine that in his second term as president he'd force every pregnant woman to submit to constant government monitoring.\"\n",
            "Verdict: False\n",
            "Reasoning: The statement is not plausible because it attributes a highly unusual and controversial policy to President Donald Trump without providing any supporting evidence. The claim of \"constant government monitoring\" of pregnant women is extremely invasive and not something that any president would publicly support. Furthermore, it is not something that a reputable magazine like TIME would misquote or misrepresent in their article.\n",
            "Statement: \"Joe Biden graduated 76th academically in a class of 85 students at Syracuse University College of Law in 1968.\"\n",
            "Verdict: True\n",
            "Reasoning: According to multiple reputable sources, including The New York Times and The Washington Post, Joe Biden graduated 76th out of 85 students in his class at Syracuse University College of Law in 1968. This information is not only plausible but has been corroborated by credible news outlets.\n",
            "Statement: \"Only two presidents in American history left office with fewer jobs than when they entered office. Herbert Hoover and yes, Donald Herbert Hoover Trump.\"\n",
            "Verdict: Mostly False\n",
            "Reasoning: The statement is mostly false because while it's true that both Presidents Herbert Hoover and Richard Nixon left office with a lower number of jobs than when they started, the name of the second president is incorrect in the statement. It should be Richard Nixon, not Donald Herbert Hoover Trump.\n",
            "Statement: \"The top donor to a major super PAC supporting Donald Trump for president in 2024 is also the top donor to the super PAC supporting Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for president.\"\n",
            "Verdict: Unverifiable\n",
            "Reasoning: The statement requires specific names and details that are not provided. It's asking for comparative information about the top donors to two different super PACs, one supporting Donald Trump for president in 2024 and the other supporting Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for president. Without these specific names and relevant data, it's impossible to fact-check this statement.\n",
            "Statement: \"Now, if I don’t get elected, it’s going to be a bloodbath for the whole — that’s gonna be the least of it. It’s going to be a bloodbath for the country.\"\n",
            "Verdict: Unverifiable\n",
            "Reasoning: This statement is highly subjective and lacks specific criteria for evaluation. The use of the term \"bloodbath\" is metaphorical and could mean different things to different people. Without a clear definition of what \"bloodbath\" means in this context, it is not possible to fact-check the statement. Furthermore, the outcome of the election and its impact on the country are speculative and dependent on various unpredictable factors.\n",
            "Statement: \"U.S. President Joe Biden is the first president to skip a cognitive test during an annual physical exam.\"\n",
            "Verdict: Mostly True\n",
            "Reasoning: According to reports, previous presidents including Donald Trump and Ronald Reagan have taken cognitive tests during their physical exams. However, there is no official rule or law that requires a president to take a cognitive test. The annual physical exam for U.S. Presidents is quite comprehensive but it does not explicitly include a cognitive test. Joe Biden, at the age of 78, became the oldest president to take office in U.S. history. While he did take a cognitive test prior to the 2020 election, he did not take one during his first annual physical exam as president in 2021. Therefore, it's mostly true that Joe Biden is the first president to skip a cognitive test during an annual physical exam, given the context that no law mandates such a test and that none of his predecessors were known to have taken one during their annual physicals.\n",
            "Statement: \"In February 2024, Nikki Haley lost the Nevada presidential primary to 'None of These Candidates.' \"\n",
            "Verdict: Unverifiable\n",
            "Reasoning: The statement is about a future event, specifically the 2024 Nevada presidential primary. As I don't have real-time data or the ability to predict future events, I can't definitively say whether the statement is true or false. Furthermore, the statement requires specific details about the outcome of a future election, which is subject to various unpredictable factors.\n",
            "Statement: \"U.S. President Joe Biden is the only presidential candidate to win a primary election as a write-in candidate.\"\n",
            "Verdict: Mostly False\n",
            "Reasoning: While it's true that Joe Biden did win the Delaware primary in 2020 as a write-in candidate, he was not the only presidential candidate to have ever done so. For instance, Joe Lieberman, then running for Vice President in 2000, won the Connecticut primary as a write-in candidate. Therefore, while the statement contains an element of truth, it is not unique to Joe Biden.\n",
            "Statement: \"Former U.S. President Donald Trump is the first presidential candidate to win the New Hampshire primary three times.\"\n",
            "Verdict: True\n",
            "Reasoning: Donald Trump did win the New Hampshire primary in 2016, 2020, and also in 2016 during the Republican Party's primary election. Even though the statement doesn't explicitly mention that it's within the same party's primaries, it's generally implied when talking about a president's primaries record. Therefore, the statement is factual.\n",
            "Statement: \"Former U.S. President Donald Trump's margin of victory in the 2024 Republican Iowa caucuses was the smallest of any GOP candidate in history.\"\n",
            "Verdict: Unverifiable\n",
            "Reasoning: The statement is about a future event, the 2024 Republican Iowa caucuses, and makes a comparative claim about Donald Trump's margin of victory. Since the caucuses have not yet taken place, there is no data or evidence available to verify this claim. Therefore, it is currently unverifiable.\n",
            "Statement: \"U.S. Republican 2024 presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy received money from billionaire George Soros.\"\n",
            "Verdict: Unverifiable\n",
            "Reasoning: The statement connects two individuals, Vivek Ramaswamy and George Soros, but it does not provide enough context or evidence to confirm the alleged transaction. To fact-check this statement, we would need specific details about the supposed monetary exchange, such as dates, amounts, and purposes. Without this information, it is not possible to classify the statement as true or false.\n",
            "Statement: \"Have you had to cancel or rethink any upcoming summer trips because of high prices? Don’t worry — your taxpayer dollars will be used to pay for illegal immigrants to fly into a town near you.\"\n",
            "Verdict: False\n",
            "Reasoning: The first part of the statement about cancelling summer trips due to high prices is a personal experience and cannot be fact-checked. However, the second part of the statement about taxpayer dollars paying for illegal immigrants to fly into towns is not factual. The U.S. government does not have a program that uses taxpayer dollars for such purposes. This kind of action would also be widely publicized and controversial, which it has not been.\n",
            "Statement: \"Unlike the Democrats, who are KILLING SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE by allowing the INVASION OF THE MIGRANTS, I will NOT, under any circumstance, allow either of these two precious GEMS to be even touched under a Trump Administration. Biden is killing them both with the INVASION, while at the same time destroying our Country!\"\n",
            "Verdict: False\n",
            "Reasoning: This statement is largely based on opinion and contains inflammatory language, making it difficult to fact-check directly. However, the claim that Democrats are allowing the \"invasion of migrants\" and are \"killing\" Social Security and Medicare is false. The state of these programs depends on various factors, including legislation and economic conditions, not solely on immigration or a political party. Additionally, the use of capitalization and exclamation points does not add factual evidence to support the claim.\n",
            "Statement: \"We know that President Biden didn’t just create this border crisis. He invited it with 94 executive actions in his first 100 days. When I took office, I took a different approach. I traveled to the Del Rio sector of Texas. That’s where I spoke to a woman who shared her story with me. She had been sex trafficked by the cartels starting at the age of 12. She told me not just that she was raped every day, but how many times a day she was raped. The cartels put her on a mattress in a shoe box of a room, and they sent men through that door over and over again for hours and hours on end. We wouldn’t be okay with this happening in a Third World country. This is the United States of America, and it is past time, in my opinion, that we start acting like it. President Biden’s border policies are a disgrace.\"\n",
            "Verdict: Unverifiable\n",
            "Reasoning: The statement contains a mix of verifiable and unverifiable information. It is true that President Biden implemented several executive actions related to immigration during his first 100 days in office. However, the claim that these actions \"invited\" the border crisis is subjective and not easily verifiable. The anecdote about the woman who was sex trafficked cannot be verified as true or false without additional context and evidence. The statement also includes a subjective opinion about President Biden's border policies being a \"disgrace,\" which is not factual or falsifiable.\n",
            "Statement: \"You remember they [Iran] fired. They hit one of our drones and I hit them. …. They called us to tell us that we’re going to hit back. Here’s the target, but we’re not going to hit the target. We’re going to just miss it. It’s a military base.\"\n",
            "Verdict: Unverifiable\n",
            "Reasoning: The statement refers to an event that allegedly happened involving military actions between the U.S. and Iran. However, without specific details such as the date, location, and official confirmation from reliable sources, it is not possible to fact-check this statement. Therefore, it is classified as unverifiable.\n",
            "Statement: \"Look, folks, you know how many billionaires we have in America today? One thousand. You know what their average rate — tax rate — federal tax rate is? Federal tax rate is 8.5 percent. Raise your hand if you’d trade your tax rate for 8.5 percent. I’m serious. Think about this. There’d be $40 billion raised if they even pay 25 percent.\"\n",
            "Verdict: Mostly False\n",
            "Reasoning: The statement contains some cherry-picked data and misleading information. According to the most recent data from the IRS, the top 1% of taxpayers pay an average federal tax rate of 27.1%, not 8.5%. The 8.5% figure might be accurate for a specific subset of the extremely wealthy, but it does not represent the overall tax burden of the top 1,000 billionaires. Additionally, the statement assumes that raising the federal tax rate for billionaires to 25% would generate $40 billion, but this is a rough estimate at best, as it doesn't take into account various deductions, exemptions, or tax avoidance strategies that could significantly impact the actual amount raised.\n",
            "Statement: \"We had the best unemployment rates ever. And they were real unemployment, not like you have today where nobody’s working and they consider it to be. It’s a whole different thing. Too complicated to explain, but it’s a whole different thing. You don’t have to know about it.\"\n",
            "Verdict: Mostly False\n",
            "Reasoning: The statement is mostly false because it is subjective and lacks specific data. The claim of having the \"best unemployment rates ever\" cannot be verified without concrete numbers. Moreover, the assertion that current unemployment statistics are not \"real\" is misleading. While it is true that there are different ways to measure unemployment, the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses standardized methods to ensure accurate and consistent data. The statement then dismisses the complexity of this topic, which further undermines its credibility.\n",
            "Statement: \"House Republicans took numerous votes that would have damaged economic growth and harmed our national security, like attempting to eliminate over 2,000 Border Patrol agents.\"\n",
            "Verdict: Unverifiable\n",
            "Reasoning: The statement is not entirely clear and lacks sufficient context. It's unverifiable because it doesn't specify the time frame or the legislative measures in question. Without this information, it's impossible to accurately determine if the statement is factual or not.\n",
            "Statement: \"We didn’t sell any land to the Chinese. But, yes, I recruited a fiberglass company.\"\n",
            "Verdict: Half True\n",
            "Reasoning: The statement acknowledges that land was not sold to the Chinese, which is a true statement if taken literally. However, it also admits to recruiting a fiberglass company, which could potentially involve some form of land transaction or ownership. The statement is only half true because it fails to clarify the exact nature of the fiberglass company's operations in the country, leaving room for speculation regarding potential land deals with Chinese interests.\n",
            "Statement: \"The climate change agenda is a hoax … The reality is more people are dying of bad climate change policies than they are of actual climate change.\"\n",
            "Verdict: Mostly False\n",
            "Reasoning: The claim that the climate change agenda is a hoax is not supported by scientific evidence. While it's true that some climate policies may have negative impacts, the statement conflates the idea of imperfect policies with the validity of climate change itself. Furthermore, the assertion that \"more people are dying of bad climate change policies than they are of actual climate change\" is an overgeneralization and not supported by available data. Climate change has been linked to increased mortality rates due to factors such as extreme weather events, heatwaves, and disease spread, among others.\n",
            "Statement: \"How are we supposed to get our girls used to the fact that biological boys are in their locker rooms? And then we wonder why a third of our teenage girls seriously contemplated suicide last year.\"\n",
            "Verdict: Mostly False\n",
            "Reasoning: The statement conflates two separate issues: the presence of transgender students in gender-segregated facilities and mental health issues among teenage girls. While it's true that some schools allow transgender boys (biological girls who identify as male) to use the boys' locker rooms, the statement exaggerates the prevalence of this situation. Moreover, the correlation between the two issues is not established in the statement, making it misleading. The high suicide contemplation rate among teenage girls can have various causes, and it's inappropriate to attribute it solely to the presence of transgender students in their facilities.\n",
            "Statement: \"China’s eyes and ears — dangerously close, too dangerous to lead.\"\n",
            "Verdict: Unverifiable\n",
            "Reasoning: This statement is highly subjective and lacks specificity, making it unverifiable. The phrases \"eyes and ears\" and \"dangerously close, too dangerous to lead\" are metaphorical and require context to be properly understood and evaluated. Without additional information, it's impossible to fact-check this statement.\n",
            "Statement: \"Hundreds of people on our terrorist watch list are crossing our borders.\"\n",
            "Verdict: Mostly False\n",
            "Reasoning: This statement is difficult to fact-check without specific data, but generally, it's unlikely that hundreds of people on a terrorist watch list are crossing the border. The number of individuals on such lists is relatively small, and border control agencies have systems in place to monitor and control high-risk individuals. While it's plausible that some individuals might slip through the cracks, the claim of \"hundreds\" seems exaggerated and not supported by available evidence.\n",
            "Statement: \"This trial that I have now, that’s a Biden trial.\"\n",
            "Verdict: Unverifiable\n",
            "Reasoning: The statement is too vague to be fact-checked. The phrase \"a Biden trial\" is not clear about what it refers to. If it's about a trial involving Joe Biden or his administration, more specific information is needed to verify the statement.\n",
            "Statement: \"President Biden is the first candidate in history, the first president in history, that has used the federal agencies to censor political speech ... to censor his opponent.\"\n",
            "Verdict: Mostly False\n",
            "Reasoning: The statement is mostly false because while it's true that under President Biden's administration, the Department of Justice has asked for a review of social media companies' voluntary actions to reduce the spread of misinformation, there is no evidence to suggest that this was done specifically to censor political speech or his opponent. The use of the term \"first\" is also misleading, as it implies that no other president has ever used federal agencies in this way, which is not verifiable and likely false.\n",
